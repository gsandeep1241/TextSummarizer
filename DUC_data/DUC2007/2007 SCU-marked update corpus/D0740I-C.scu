its drawback is that as it expands from the sun's heat, it threatens to tear a balloon apart and must be vented, depleting its supply.</line><line>Hot air can provide lifting power whenever it is needed, but only by carrying huge fuel supplies to heat the air; when the fuel runs out, the balloon comes down.</line><line>But a Rozier combines both, taking advantage of helium's lift during daylight, and supplementing it at night with hot air.</line><line>While there is no obvious practical benefit from this spectacular feat, the technological advances in balloon design engendered by the competition may well end up benefiting scientific research.</line><line>Scientists already use unpiloted high-altitude balloons extensively to conduct some kinds of environmental monitoring and astronomical studies that require a perch high above most of the atmosphere.</line><line>Fellow balloonist Richard Branson, whose latest attempt to circle the world ended with a landing off Hawaii last Christmas because of bad weather ahead, immediately sent his congratulatious to the rival team Saturday, calling it a &quot;magnificent achievement.&quot;</line><line>For the adventurers themselves, the achievement still hadn't quite sunk in.</line><line>&quot;We are having great difficulty realizing our dreams have come true,&quot;
