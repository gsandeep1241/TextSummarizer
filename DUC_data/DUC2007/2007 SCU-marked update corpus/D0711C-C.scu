Elhauge said, &quot;and it is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him&quot; on his factual findings.</line><line>If those findings are accepted, Elhauge said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears &quot;entirely sensible&quot; under legal precedents.</line><line>Lesser remedies like orders to monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult to police, he said.</line><line>Several experts said one of Jackson's legally risky decisions was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied together.</line><line>Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product, like a salt packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product, like raw salt, to get the popular product.</line><line>But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows, portions of Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal.</line><line>It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="52,54"/></line><line>Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal.</line><line>But even on that subject, Moglen said, Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his approach as consistent with the law.</line><line>&quot;He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly be,&quot; Moglen said, adding that he thought Jackson had worked to try to protect the decisions from being overturned.</line><line>Several of the legal experts said Thursday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving computer business.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="37"><scu uid="53" label="They (Microsoft) argued that Judge Jackson relied on outdated antitrust concepts that not applicable to the fast-paced computer business" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>They said that the computer age might require adjustments to some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating system and a Web browser are really separate products.</line><line>But, some of them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets competitive.</line><line>Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the victim of an injustice was a familiar defense.</line><line>&quot;Every industry, as it is growing,&quot;
