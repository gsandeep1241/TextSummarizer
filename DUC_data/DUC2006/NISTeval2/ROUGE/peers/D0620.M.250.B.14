``He can double the number of weapons just with a jacket on,'' Michael Dorn, school safety specialist and Chris' father, said Tuesday during the school security workshop sponsored by the Oklahoma Schools Advisory Council.
''You need some basic security measures in schools,'' he said.
When school shootings such as the ones that occurred in Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon happen, some districts look, listen and search for ways not to become the next Littleton.
Police SWAT teams have also drilled at Seattle schools, Ferrar said.
At Seattle's Ballard High School, principal Chuck Chinn followed the advice of district security officials and recently stepped up locker checks and random sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors, a procedure that had only occasionally been used before the Colorado killings.
Hobbs's precautions _ taken in response to a death threat telephoned to the local sheriff's department on Monday _ seem a fitting punctuation mark to a school year that can't end soon enough for students, teachers, administrators and parents.
``At the point of attack, very few of the measures we could have, or do have, in place probably would have prevented the Columbine incident,'' said Edward Ray, director of security for Denver public schools.
Last month in Palm Beach County, Fla., for example, drama students with fake wounds pretended to be casualties as officers stormed a school and ``arrested'' police academy recruits who were pretending to take hostages and plant bombs, all under the gaze of television cameras.
