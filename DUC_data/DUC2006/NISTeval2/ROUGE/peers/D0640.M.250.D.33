It quoted an expert involved in the operation as saying the submarine could have been damaged by a blast in its bow which caused the torpedo section to fill with water.
There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy.
Officials have been pessimistic about the chances that the crew of the submarine could be saved.
U.S. officials have said that two American submarines were in the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included the Kursk.
He said that after the Kursk shot a buoy to the surface to warn that it was in trouble, men on two Russian ships detected signs of a large underwater object ``equivalent in size'' to the Kursk.
The "Kursk", with a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and able to dive to an depth of up to 500 meters, was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.
Russian and NATO officials held a four-hour meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss what kind of assistance the western alliance could offer to help save the 118 crew of a nuclear submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.
All efforts to evacuate the 118 submariners aboard the ill- fated Kursk have so far bore no result, but the rescue operation is continuing with 22 surface ships at the site of the accident.
