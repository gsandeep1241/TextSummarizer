A senior administration official said that Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier, has been working with the Islamic militant government in Sudan since 1995 to develop and buy dual use equipment that can be used to produce VX and other weapons of mass destruction.
Although the administration says the precursor has no other use than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical weapons, said another administration official, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference Thursday the administration had bombed Chemical Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan the intelligence community was " confident " the plant was " involved in the production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor chemicals for deadly V-series." The diplomats and the former government official said it was not absolutely clear at which of several plants the Iraqis were working on chemical weapons or their precursors.
Jonathan Tucker, director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons nonproliferation project at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said that there were three likely possibilities for those agents: the main precursors phosphorous trichloride or phosphorous pentasulfide, both of which are used in the production of certain pesticides, and another important ingredient, diisopropyl ethylamine.
Stimson Center, an arms research organization in Washington, said it would not take a large amount of precursor chemicals or space to make a weapon.
