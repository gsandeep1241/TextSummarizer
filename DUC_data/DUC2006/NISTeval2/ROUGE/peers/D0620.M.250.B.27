That shooting led to the widespread use of metal detectors, now installed at 70 city schools.
And in towns as small as Allen, Texas, many students returning to school will find metal detectors and armed security guards at the door, while others will have to trade their battered canvas backpacks for see-through bags designed to make it harder to conceal a weapon.
Some districts, by contrast, have rejected the idea of detection systems, finding them an affront to educational openness, and are concentrating instead on a drumbeat of programs to make students feel more responsible for their school's safety and less reluctant to report violations.
The new policies vary widely, but virtually all are a direct reaction to the shootings this spring at high schools in Littleton, Colo., and here in Georgia, in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers.
Reacting to Columbine, New York state officials are requiring districts to report major violent acts_bomb threats, explosions, shootings_to the state Department of Education within 48 hours of the incident.
In dozens of locales as disparate as Pittsburgh and Palm Beach County, Fla., SWAT teams have spent the summer learning the layouts of high schools and conducting drills involving mock hostage-taking.
The exercises provided useful training to police in the unfamiliar territory of a school building, while also sending a message of control to parents and teachers.
Nevertheless, surveys have shown a level of anxiety among parents and students over school violence.
