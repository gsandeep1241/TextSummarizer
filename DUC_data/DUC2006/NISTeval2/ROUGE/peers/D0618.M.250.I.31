Malaria causes an estimated 300 to 300 million acute cases per year, with most deaths occurring among children in Africa. "In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease," it said, adding that research and development in malaria prevention and treatment have made advances.
Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides.
Around the world, malaria kills 3,000 children under 5 every day, a higher mortality rate than AIDS.
Drug combinations for multi-drug resistance malaria and vaccines against malaria are being developed at the global level while insecticide-treated mosqui nets and curtains have emerged in recent years as a promising tool to prevent malaria disease.
Americans won a new drug Friday to prevent malaria when they travel to countries ravaged by the mosquito-borne infection.
Malaria is a parasitic infection that is one of the world's worst scourges.
Since there is no vaccine against malaria, prevention depends on two important measures: taking a drug that combats the parasite prophylactically _ that is, in advance of any known infection _ and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito.
The malaria problem is increasing because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to some of the anti-malaria drugs and insecticides.
