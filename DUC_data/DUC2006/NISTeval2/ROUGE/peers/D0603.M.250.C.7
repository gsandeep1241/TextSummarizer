Thursday's action by its New York district suspends some of the permit procedures that are in effect elsewhere in the country.
Fines for the illegal destruction of wetlands can be as high as $ 10,000 per day.
The EPA has not identified any significant pollution from the discharge at this point, he added.
Jack Landy, an environmental engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco, said the EPA supports Tres Rios and is impressed with the planning going into the project.
The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to $ 27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna.
By law, DeMarco should have sought a state permit before undertaking the expansion.
Each grower is limited to a maximum wetlands expansion of 10 acres in any year.
That led to Tres Rios, a demonstration project near 91st Avenue and Broadway Road.
Congress approved $ 3.75 million for the artificial wetlands to filter the contaminated water through a process known as bioremediation.
The state Department of Environmental Protection sent a letter in October 1998 to DeMarco, alerting him of the violation.
The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act.
