With an honor guard in crisp blue uniforms standing at attention on the deck and its flags snapping in the breeze, the nuclear submarine Kursk glided silently out to sea, a symbol of Russian power and pride.
Russian officials' assertions on Monday that the Kursk sank after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the kind of suspicions that were common during the Cold War, when on more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged into one another.
Kursk's nuclear reactors appear to have shut down, plunging the submarine into darkness.
One Russian submarine was so badly damaged after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank, the Russian navy contends.
But they have said that neither submarine was close to the Russian vessel.
Various Russian reports said the submarine was 330 to 510 feet down.
Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet below the surface were foundering.
Foreign-Aided Rescue Efforts Continue, Hope Dim.
British and Norwegian rescuers joined their Russian counterparts late Saturday in efforts to rescue the Kursk nuclear submarine that has been stranded at the bottom of the Barents Sea for a week.
Russian officials maintain that the Kursk collided with a large object such as a foreign submarine, or with a World War II mine, but they have also considered the possibility that a torpedo inside the submarine misfired.
