And most adherents of the dominant view readily acknowledge that the size of the human contribution to global warming is not yet known.
Over the years, skeptics have tried to cast doubt on the idea of global warming by noting that measurements taken by earth satellites since 1979 have found little or no temperature rise in large parts of the upper atmosphere.

In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global warming to changes in circulation patterns.
