Public release of reports compiling the facts in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last fall off the New England coast.
Investigators, aided by several Arabic interpreters, pored over the cockpit voice recorder of EgyptAir Flight 990 to try to determine whether a criminal act caused the plane to crash two weeks ago killing all 217 people on board.
The safety board is expected to release more information from the flight data recorder.
Egyptian Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Ibrahim el-Demiri said that he did not rule out the possibility that EgyptAir Flight 990 was downed by electromagnetic interference.
One of the black boxes of the plane on the EgyptAir Flight 990 has been recovered, U.S. searchers announced.
The disclosure comes after the chairman of EgyptAir told a news conference in Cairo that something happened to the tail of the Boeing 767 that caused it to go into a near supersonic dive before the plane broke up and crashed into the sea.
Egyptian pilots have demanded the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board hand over the probe into the 1999 EgyptAir plane crash to a third party if it fails to release key evidence, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported.
