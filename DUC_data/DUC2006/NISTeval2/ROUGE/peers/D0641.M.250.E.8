Climate scientists from around the world are in wide agreement that global warming is real.''.
Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might have a similar effect.
Global warming in the lower atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
Environmentalists are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall global warming.
Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global warming.
Studies have disagreed on whether the warming would produce the El-Nino-like Pacific surface temperatures .
