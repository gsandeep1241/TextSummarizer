Bouchard, who until Jean Charest was 46 never saw any other part of Canada except the next-door province of Ontario, is typical of many people here for whom Quebec is already a nation.
Quebec is the only province in Canada that does not allow drivers to make a right turn at a red light.
The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
People in the province voted to stay in Canada instead of separation in the October referendum two years ago.
Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80 percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada. The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from the country.
`` Parti Quebecois has failed to become the leading contender for Quebec 's champion against Ottawa,'' said Desmond Morton, director of the Institute for the Study of Canada at McGill University in Montreal.
OTTAWA, May 15 ( Xinhua ) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
