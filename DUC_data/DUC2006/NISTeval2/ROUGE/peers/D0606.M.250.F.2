WASHINGTON (AP Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
Alusa noted that UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts of climate change on eco-systems and the socio-economic system of countries.
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
Long-term climate change such as global warming could have major impacts on human health, the environment, the economy and society, said Dr. James Baker, Director of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global warming on the United States over the next 100 years.
