``So, most of the young people who are moving into positions of power tend to soft pedal their authority because of perceived hostility.'' ``Word got out that we cared about young people and that we tried to get them involved in things,'' Lieberman said.
``As a result, we got lucky and ended up with some very good young people.'' ``We started recruiting young people right out of college that we think have talent,'' he said.
``So we get bright young people who can take apart a computer and put it back together again,'' said Susan Finley, co-chair of the Montgomery County Republican Party who also sits on the Board of Elections.
At age 68, Finley calls herself the ``house mother'' of the local election board.
