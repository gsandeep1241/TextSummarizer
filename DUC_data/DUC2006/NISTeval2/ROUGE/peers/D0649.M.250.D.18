Apart from the daily TV accounts of Putin's activities as president and his trips to the provinces, there are few signs that Russia is less than three weeks from a critical election.
Putin has not accepted Zyuganov's challenge to debate him and issues have barely surfaced.
With President-elect Vladimir Putin moving to put his government in place, Moscow is rife with behind-the-scenes intrigue as he and his aides try to decide which politicians, economists and tycoons should be included in his inner circle.
The move also rewards Sergeyev for his loyalty and quiets the infighting with Russia's defense establishment over his post.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's announcement Friday to resign and name Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president has surprised the nation and many say the move will further boost Putin's chance of winning the presidential race.
They indicate that Russia's top foreign policy priorities would include improving and developing ties with and seeking economic assistance from the West, repairing and strengthening ties with other CIS countries to safeguard Russia's ``vital interests'' in the so-called near abroad.
But the fairly strong vote for Zyuganov was also seen as a protest by Russians unhappy about Putin's apparently inevitable victory.
The publisher, Vagrius, had planned to put 500,000 copies up for sale, but pulled back after being told by election officials that selling the book would violate Russia's election law and even lead to Putin's dismissal from the race.
