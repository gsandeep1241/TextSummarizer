Developing Mongolian-Japanese relations is of primary importance, as Japan has supported Mongolia's reform and provided it with economic and technical assistance, Bagabandy said.
China's economic aid to Mongolia has also played an important role in the economic development of Mongolia, according to Jasray.
He reiterated that Mongolia always sticks to a "one China" policy, and recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government representing China.
Noting that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, Jasray said that Mongolia opposes Taiwan's entry into the United Nations.
He added that Mongolia will not have any official contact with Taiwan, except some non-governmental trade exchanges.
Bagabandy, who was sworn in as Mongolia's new president Sunday, said that in recent years Mongolia has expanded its cooperation with China, and the two countries have enhanced mutual understanding and trust between them.
China has always understood the importance of developing a long-term, stable, and good-neighborly friendship with Mongolia, and any changes in Mongolia's political system and government will not affect China's consistent and friendly policies toward the country.
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made the comment here this afternoon during his talks with Mongolian Minister of External Relations Shukher Altangerel, who is on his first visit abroad since he took office.
At the seventh international meeting for assistance to Mongolia held in June, Japan promised to provide 115 million dollars worth of loans in aid to Mongolia within the coming 18 months.
The United States will continue
