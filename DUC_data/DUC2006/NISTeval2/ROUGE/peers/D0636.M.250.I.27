The dispute was largely over job security and ``outsourcing,'' the practice of contracting in-house work to outside suppliers who generally pay less and typically are nonunion.
With union leaders also nervous about a showdown with German executives they barely know, the union is expected to negotiate the first contract with GM or, perhaps more likely, Ford.
In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits from the automaker, not the subsidiary.
GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich.
Four out of every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the UAW's grip on the industry and erodes its membership.
The UAW has been quarreling with DaimlerChrysler over how much help the automaker should give the union in organizing a Mercedes factory in Alabama and a DaimlerChrysler heavy truck factory in North Carolina.
At the Delphi East spark plug and speedometer factory, the other plant on strike here, the two sides were still at an impasse over GM's plan to send work to outside sources, a move that the union contended would cut at least 2,500 jobs.
