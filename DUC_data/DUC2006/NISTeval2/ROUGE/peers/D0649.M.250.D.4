Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday announced that he wanted acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to succeed him as Russia's next president in next summer elections.
Russian acting President, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will not leave Russia for a visit before the presidential election scheduled for March 26, said a top Kremlin official Tuesday.
The economic program that acting President Vladimir Putin has said he will unveil before this month's elections will combine liberalization measures with stronger state regulation, the man heading its development said Thursday.
For a candidate who insists he's too busy being president to campaign, Vladimir Putin is spending a lot of time on the road, running one of the slickest election campaigns Russians have ever seen.
" I think that it would be offered to the public even before the election, " Putin said on a recent trip, then quickly added : " Surely, before the election." Acting President Vladimir Putin, a steely enigma to most Russians, lets his guard down a little in a book of interviews released Monday, less than two weeks before the presidential elections.
MOSCOW - An energetic-looking President-elect Vladimir Putin arrived at work Monday to meet with government leaders, but instead of triumphant speeches about his election victory, Putin shed no light about which way he 'll lead the economy and society.
With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
