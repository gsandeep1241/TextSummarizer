The virus, commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East, is spread to humans by mosquitoes.
West Nile encephalitis cannot be passed from person to person, or from birds to people; the virus must pass through a mosquito.
This year West Nile virus apparently caused illness among humans in Volgograd, Russia, though Gubler said Gubler had received no reply to an inquiry he has made to Russian scientists about the outbreak.
Gubler said scientists also needed to investigate whether the deaths of the birds indicated that West Nile virus had become more virulent.
After a nearly two-decade silence, West Nile virus caused a large outbreak in Romania in 1996.
The West Nile virus found in Queens is genetically very similar to the strain that turned up in Israel. The West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause encephalitis or inflammation of the brain.
No one knows which birds carry the virus, which is similar to the West Nile virus of Africa.
So far this year the virus has appeared only in birds and mosquitoes - bloodsucking insects that can spread West Nile to humans.
''Since we are finding West Nile virus in birds in counties well outside of the area originally infected, and many birds are too young to fly far, it is likely that the virus is present throughout New York state,'' Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello said.
