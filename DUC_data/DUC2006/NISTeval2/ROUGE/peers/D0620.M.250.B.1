EDISON, N.J.
(AP) -- Lawrence Middle School has a bullying policy.
Hunterdon Central Regional High School students walk around with identification badges.
And in Hamilton Square, guidance counselors are ordered to tell administrators when a student talks of wanting to hurt someone.
School administrators sharing their tactics for averting school violence at a second annual conference Wednesday unveiled elaborate safety plans and said they preferred to err on the side of caution when dealing with threats of violence.
''You can never be too safe,'' said Linda Batz, the principal of Hunterdon Central Regional.
Since two teen-agers at Columbine High School killed twelve other students, a teacher and themselves in Littleton, Colo., on April 20, 1999, some critics have said that schools have taken zero-tolerance discipline policies to the extreme.
Sayreville school officials said they would review the district's zero-tolerance policy after complaints about the three-day suspension of four kindergartners who were pointing their fingers at each other while playing ''cops and robbers'' in the playground.
Six elementary school students in Plainfield were suspended for two days in March after an 11-year-old boy threatened to ''get a gun'' if other children did not stop teasing him.
Joe Duca, a retired police officer who works as a security coordinator for the South Brunswick Schools, said school officials are fearful of not doing enough to stop another Columbine.
''I think everybody is running scared,'' Duca said.
''They're afraid of being held responsible'' if a school threat escalates into violence.
