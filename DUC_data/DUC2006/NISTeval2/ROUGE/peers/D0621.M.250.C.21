The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic principles, namely "conviction and penalty according to law," "equality of everyone before the law" and "punishment commensurate with the crime".
It stipulates: "there should be no conviction or penalty if an act is not explicitly defined as a criminal act by the law," "all criminal offenders are equal in applying laws," and that "the severity of penalty should be commensurate with the offender's crime and due criminal liabilities".
These three principles have further improved China's principle of rule of law, and are conducive to judicial fairness and to the protection of the legitimate rights of the litigants, the white paper states.
China has revised the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law, promulgated and enforced new laws such as the Lawyers' Law and the Law on Administrative Punishment to strengthen the judicial guarantee for human rights during that period of time, the paper says.
Zhang said that China amended its Criminal Law recently to enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering, terrorist crime, trafficking of illegal immigrants and environment-related crimes.
China's deputy minister of justice, Zhang Geng, made the remarks in a speech at the Sixth Session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs which entered China from overseas.
