Worm.Explore.Zip targets computers using Microsoft Windows operating systems.
People who suspect their computer may be infected should start with steps 3 and 4, make sure their systems are virus-free, and then do steps 1 and 2.
The new bug is only known to attack computers using Microsoft operating systems Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT.
Rival operating systems such as Macintosh and Unix apparently are not vulnerable.
Worm.Explore.Zip is the third major bug to sweep across the Internet since late March, when the Melissa virus overwhelmed systems with floods of e-mail.
A more damaging virus named Chernobyl struck in late April, but did most of its harm overseas.

``This was the country's worst computer disaster,'' said Ahmed Hasan, general secretary of the Computer Society in Bangladesh.
But computer experts feared that more locally-created viruses would affect machines across the country as more students enrolled in computer courses.
"It will soon be a reality in Bangladesh where the local virus creators would reign," computer expert Anko Shohel was quoted as saying.

He remains free on $100,000 bail.
CERT has not determined where the Melissa virus originated.
