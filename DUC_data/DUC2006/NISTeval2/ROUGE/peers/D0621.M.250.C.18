China has revised the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law, promulgated and enforced new laws such as the Lawyers 'Law and the Law on Administrative Punishment to strengthen the judicial guarantee for human rights during that period of time, the paper says.
It has cracked down on serious criminal offenses in accordance with law, and earnestly guaranteed the people's human rights and safety of lives and property, it states.
In 1996, public security and judicial departments launched, according to law, a severe nationwide crack down on criminal offenses seriously endangering public security, such as homicides, robberies, rape, kidnapping and blackmail, and major theft, with emphasis placed on crimes involving the use of guns, crimes with gangster connections and characteristics, and crimes committed by rogue and vicious social forces, it says.
Statistics show that in 1996, courts throughout the country sentenced 322,382 criminal offenders who had seriously endangered public security by committing crimes of violence, crimes involving the use of guns, and gang-related crimes.
The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic principles, namely ``conviction and penalty according to law,'' ``equality of everyone before the law'' and ``punishment commensurate with the crime''.
It stipulates: ``there should be no conviction or penalty if an act is not explicitly defined as a criminal act by the law,'' ``all criminal offenders are equal in applying laws,'' and that ``the severity of penalty should be commensurate with the offender's crime and due criminal liabilities.''
