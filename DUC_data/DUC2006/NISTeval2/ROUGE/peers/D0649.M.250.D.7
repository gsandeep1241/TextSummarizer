His trip, heavily covered by Russian state media, was also a campaign swing.
Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, also expressed the belief that Yeltsin's resignation will pave the way for Putin's race into the Kremlin.
But Putin has made it clear he will be in no hurry to decide everything.
Putin's rise from little-known bureaucrat to acting president coincided with the Chechnya war.
Russia's Central Election Commission( CEC) officially announced Wednesday that Vladimir Putin was elected president in the March 26 balloting by collecting 52.94 percent of the votes.
His detractors say he's a KGB spy, a believer in centralized power, and a ruthless prosecutor of the war in Chechnya.
As soon as the Duma ratified START II, talks began in Geneva on further cuts of warhead stockpiles.
Although Putin's victory has been expected since former President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation on Dec. 31, the novice politician appeared unprepared with the first tough tasks of office, namely nominating a new prime minister and Cabinet.
The Central Electoral Commission approved Zyuganov's candidacy in a unanimous vote Tuesday after reviewing the required 500,000 signatures of support he had submitted, commission spokesman Artyom Golev said.
Against the background of intensified efforts by the West to draw Ukraine closer to its lot, Putin's trip became all the more important.
Prior to his nomination, Putin was director of the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the feared Soviet KGB, where he served for 15 years as an agent.
Yeltsin made up his mind
