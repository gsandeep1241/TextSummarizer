Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
``The thing that screams out here is that from the inter-tidal zone to the open ocean, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, we are seeing worrisome things everywhere that seem to be most closely correlated with climate change''.
The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming.
``The speed of change caused by the change in climate is greater than most ecosystems are going to be able to adapt to''.
"Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change," the study said.
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that "as long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming will occur and occasion changes in the climate system".
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
