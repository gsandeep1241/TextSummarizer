Pictures from Galileo show the moon with a glimmering halo.
Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year.

Electricity is produced when Io crosses the magnetic field lines of its mother planet, Jupiter.
The probe was to continue sending basic telemetry until 3 p.m.
The aging and glitch-prone Galileo spacecraft successfully flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, overcoming huge doses of radiation and a computer problem just hours before the approach.
The spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995, completed its primary mission in 1997 and will finish a $30 million, two-year extended mission in January.
Galileo took measurements of Europa's magnetic field during a Jan. 3 flyby 218 miles above the moon.
The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer, which measures the absorption and reflection of various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa's surface.
Galileo survived the encounter, but not without some radiation hits causing erratic performance of spacecraft electronics.
The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo on July 13 and entered into Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7, was the first man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet and sent back data on its way to demise.
The probe detected extremely strong winds and very intense turbulence during its descent through Jupiter's thick atmosphere.
