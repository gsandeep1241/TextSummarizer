AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas prison system grew faster than any other in the country over the past decade, and one out of every 20 adults in the state is under the watch of the criminal justice system, according to national study released Monday.
``The sheer numbers of people in prison and jail in Texas are signs of system fixated on punishment and devoid of compassion,'' said Vincent Schiraldi, the director of the Justice Policy Institute of Washington, D.C., and a co-author of the report, ``Texas Tough: An Analysis of Incarceration and Crime Trends in the Lone Star State''.
According to the institute's study, Texas also has the nation's largest populations of probationers and parolees.
The report confirms statistics that have long been known to state criminal justice policy analysts, and several proponents of tough sanctions for lawbreakers said the numbers represent the sentiments of most Texans.
``We didn't have this prison building boom by happenstance,'' said Dianne Clements, president of the crime-victims advocacy group, Justice for All.
``It happened because the citizens and taxpayers who live here every day determined that they would no longer abide a revolving-door prison system.
We realize there is a cost, and we are ready to foot the bill''.
That cost was high and will probably get higher.
In the early 1990s, Texas voters authorized spending $1.7 billion in bonds to triple the size of the state's prison system, which now exceeds 150,000 beds.
