``Black boxes'' for cars, a technology borrowed from the airline industry, now are poised to help auto-accident investigators pin the blame on drivers responsible for causing crashes.
Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment.
Until now, however, it was difficult to extract that information from the car's air bag control module.
But a California company in March began selling a device that connects a car's onboard computer to a laptop computer to quickly extract such key information from a crashed vehicle.
The $2,500 device _ called a Crash Data Retrieval System _ is being marketed to police departments, insurance companies and auto-rental agencies to help them reconstruct crashes to determine fault.
``The system lets investigators collect objective, accurate data on crashes to enhance reconstruction (of accidents),'' said Jim Zaleski, president of Santa Barbara-based Vetronix Corp., which markets the device.
``This opens the door to a new generation of understanding and modeling automobile accidents,'' he said.
Some of the vehicles that have the capability to provide such data also can tell investigators whether the car's occupants were wearing seatbelts and whether the passenger-side air bag had been deactivated.
