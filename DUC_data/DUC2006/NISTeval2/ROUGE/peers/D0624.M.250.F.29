LONDON, February 26 -- The British government rejected Calls for Home Secretary Jack Straw to resign over the publication of details of witnesses in the Stephen Lawrence case.
Several of the named informants are now under police protection after their names were made public and the opposition Conservative party MPs have called Straw to resign for the error.
Mandela, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the award ceremony ranked among the important occasions of his life, adding, ''There's a possibility that one day I might die, and when I reach the new world I will have many fond memories.
The commission was calling for reform of the Race Relations Act to include the police, and said there must be a determination to make racial equality a reality.
She said British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately.
The report is expected to present a damning portrait of police incompetence and racial prejudice, and to conclude that the Metropolitan Police, Britain's largest police force, is guilty of pervasive institutional racism.
It will stand for the fact that this time we were able to smoke out prejudice.
It will require a determination that the real monument to Stephen Lawrence is not to be found in the laws passed by Parliament, but in the fundamental change in attitude in our society.
