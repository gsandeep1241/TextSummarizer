Using recent technological advances in climate modelling and new scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
And Tropical Depression No. 13 would become a killing machine whose 180-mph (290-kph) winds made it one of the century's strongest Atlantic hurricanes.
Reaching colossal heights, Mitch would blot out more than 10,000 lives across Central America with torrential rains, sending mudslides tumbling over villages and floodwaters to the sea.
But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's undue warming.
Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer study suggests.
Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study suggests.
Ocean currents associated with El Nio are already known to make equatorial winds blow faster and boost the angular momentum of the atmosphere.
Now Rodrigo Abarca del Rio of the French space agency's Toulouse Space Center has looked for direct evidence of this.
