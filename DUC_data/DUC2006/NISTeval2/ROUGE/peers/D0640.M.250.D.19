U.S. officials have said that two American submarines were in the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included the Kursk.
MOSCOW ( AP ) Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a top government official said Wednesday.
If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton pontoons, navy officials said.
There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy.
Russian officials' assertions on Monday that the Kursk sank after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the kind of suspicions that were common during the Cold War, when on more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged into one another.
But the Pentagon said Monday no U.S. ship or submarine was involved in the collision.
The projection of possible consequences of the accident in the Kursk for the lives of its crew remains extremely grave, the Russian navy commander, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said Tuesday.
He said that after the Kursk shot a buoy to the surface to warn that it was in trouble, men on two Russian ships detected signs of a large underwater object equivalent in size to the Kursk.
There were no new torpedoes on the submarine, Klebanov said after
