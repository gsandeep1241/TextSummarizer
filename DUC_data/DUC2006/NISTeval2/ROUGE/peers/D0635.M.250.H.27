Bush commuted Lucas' sentence to life in prison in 1998, following a recommendation by the state pardons board, after serious questions were raised about whether Lucas committed the murder he was convicted of.
Across the nation, bills have been introduced in a dozen states to halt executions.
And in New Hampshire, state lawmakers in May became the first to vote to abolish the death penalty since the Supreme Court allowed executions to resume in 1976.
Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 17-0 against recommending that Robison's sentence be commuted to life.
That meant that Bush could do no more than grant Robison a 30-day reprieve to allow him more time to appeal.
As governor, Bush's only independent authority is to grant a 30-day reprieve of an execution.
Bush has spared only one condemned inmate since becoming governor in 1995.
Texas law limits the governor's power in capital cases.
A governor may commute a death sentence or grant clemency only upon the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
In Texas, which led the nation in executions before Bush took office, public support for capital punishment is wide and deep.
But Bush has appointed every member of the parole board that can make that decision.
