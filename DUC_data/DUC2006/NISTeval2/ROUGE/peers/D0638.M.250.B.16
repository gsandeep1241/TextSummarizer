The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
The probe made the closest-ever flyby at 10:06 p.m. PDT Sunday, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
No problems were reported, however, after the closest-ever flyby of Jupiter's innermost large moon took place Sunday at 10:06 p.m. PDT, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
The probe also has detected a large hole in the Jupiter's magnetic field near Io, leading to speculation about whether Io possesses its own magnetic field.
If so, it would be the first planetary moon known to have one.
Galileo was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989.
It took the data during its flyby within 559 miles of the Jupiter's moon last December 7, as the probe passed by Io on its way to enter orbit around the Jupiter.
The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
