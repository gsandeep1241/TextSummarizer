Alusa stressed that African continent is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of widespread poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution and over-dependence on rain-fed agriculture.
"But there is a clear consensus that climate plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with more warming and more extreme events, will have a negative impact on public health in multiple ways." The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
Alusa UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts of climate change on eco-systems and the socio-economic system of countries.
According to the report, by exacerbating the production of some types of air pollutants, climate change would result in the increase in the incidence of related health problems, such as cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders.
Michael Oppenheimer,made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
It said that the first impact of climate change will be felt in the Mediterranean water resource system.
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that "as long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming will occur and occasion changes in the climate system."
