``I knew that in high doses this would be a real concern, but not at the typical doses that are prescribed for clinical treatment,'' Swanson said.
''ADHD is a serious condition, and parents who are concerned about it should talk to their children's doctors about appropriate treatment,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
She asserted that the company's ads prey on parents seeking alternative treatments.
The report found that ADHD children were generally more likely to receive other forms of treatment, such as in-school services or mental health counseling, than medication.
However, the treatment is controversial, since methylphenidate shares many of the pharmacological effects of cocaine and is addictive to test animals.
Such a test would go far to resolve a continuing and intense dispute about whether stimulant medications like Ritalin are being overprescribed as a treatment for ADHD.
Experts, including Koplewicz, say that children with mental illness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much higher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later on in life.
Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz.
After the evaluation, he says, ``the critical thing is that you as a parent understand the diagnosis, as well as the benefits and risks of each treatment option under consideration.''
