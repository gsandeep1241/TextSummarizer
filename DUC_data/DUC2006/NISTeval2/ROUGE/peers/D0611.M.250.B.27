Aside from keeping the beetles' favorite foods under cover, farmers reported trying_with limited success_to repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays, planting cabbage family crops among aromatic herbs and vacuuming the insects off their crops with leaf blowers adapted to work in reverse.
Those characteristics put them out of reach of most botanical pesticides and even the chemicals commonly available for home use, because the pesticide has to touch the insects to kill them.
Although less than 2 percent of all food produced in the U.S. is certified organic, annual sales now total more than $6 billion said Sarah Johnston, executive director of the New York branch of the organic farming association.
By definition, organic farming eschews artificial fertilizers and pesticides, instead harnessing the power of natural substances, such as compost, bacteria and pest-targeted insects and protective netting, to build healthy soil and keep invading forces at bay.
While any farmer can opt to use these methods, those who want to label the fruits of their labors as''certified organic,'' are required to go through a three-year process that includes extensive documentation.
While the ranks of organic farmers are steadily increasing, it's still considered an oddity.
Topolos and Benziger, both practical businessmen prominent in the wine industry, are among the practitioners of biodynamic agriculture, a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as farming itself along with some New Age spirituality.
Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.
