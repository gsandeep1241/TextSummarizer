Several mutations of the fast-moving computer virus called Melissa surfaced in cyberspace Tuesday, but researchers said none seems to be as effective as the original in clogging e-mail systems.
The FBI on Friday tried to track the author of a file-destroying computer virus that has hit some of the nation's biggest corporations and infected tens of thousands of machines.
Software companies posted new virus-killing programs on their Web sites to attack the Worm.Explore.Zip virus, which enters machines in almost the same way as the recent Melissa virus by disguising itself as a friendly piece of e-mail.
Melissa infected hundreds of thousands of computers, but there were signs Friday that the new virus may not be spreading as quickly.
