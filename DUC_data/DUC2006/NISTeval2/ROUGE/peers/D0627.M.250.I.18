The gathering's sponsors were a group called also-known-as, which is a national organization of Korean adoptees ; Holt International Children's Services, the US adoption agency that started Korean adoptions in the mid-1950s after the war there ; the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, a New York-based research center that Freundlich heads ; and the Korea Society.
``Intercountry adoption split wide open the notion of secrecy, because people couldn't pretend anymore that they couldn't see the differences between parents and their children,'' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, a Holt International vice president who in 1956 became one of the first Korean orphans to be adopted by Americans.
``All this'' is international adoption, a phenomenon that has helped to alter the way Americans perceive their country and the means by which they build their families.
Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call the ``Ovarian Olympics.'' The treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions, is considered by adoption professionals and politicians active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted to reform adoption, streamline the process, and weed out corruption worldwide.
At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents.
