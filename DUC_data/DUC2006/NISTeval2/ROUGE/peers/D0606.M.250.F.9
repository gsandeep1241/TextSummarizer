"Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change," the study said.
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
WASHINGTON (AP -- Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat.
It said that the first impact of climate change will be felt in the Mediterranean water resource system.
``Climate change is coming at us much faster than many habitats are going to be able handle,'' Morgan said.
``But there is a clear consensus that climate plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with more warming and more extreme events, will have a negative impact on public health in multiple ways.
He said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
