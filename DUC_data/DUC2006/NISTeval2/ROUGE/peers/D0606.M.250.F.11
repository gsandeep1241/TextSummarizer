Welch said convinced that ocean warming reflecting broader climate change and raising possibility of large-scale potential changes in marine ecosystem. . . Wednesday's report written by Markham and University of Toronto professor Jay Malcolm used computer models to simulate global climate and vegetation change under variety of conditions . . . Biologists saying high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998 producing rate bloom of phytoplankton in northern Pacific waters typical of waters closer to equator causing changes in food chain . . . Species such as fish or bears or whales appearing to be suffering from lack of food connected to warming of ocean . . . Global warming accelerating, planting and animals coming under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat . . . Many scientists believing that high concentrations of CO2 and other-called greenhouse gases traping sun's heat in atmosphere, driving up temperatures and changing weather patterns . . . Politicians attempting to ratify 1997 Kyoto agreement limiting greenhouse-gas emissions . . . Producing dramatic shift in plankton species interfering in food supplies for marine life and seabirds . . . Report raising specter of tundra denuded of walrus and polar bear populations and New England stripped of spruce and fir forests if amount of carbon dioxide pumped into atmosphere not reduced . . . Welch attributing smaller fish and high death rate to warmer ocean waters sapping salmon of energy and strength . . .
