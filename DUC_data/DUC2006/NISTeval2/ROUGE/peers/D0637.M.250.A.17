All previous experiments on the use of solar energy have failed, due to the lack of advanced science and technology. Solar energy is even used in the area 49 degrees north latitude, it said . The energy sources include solar energy, wind power, hydro-electricity and gas generated from biological materials . Southern regions in Vietnam have the advantage to develop solar energy . In the north, though the use of solar energy is limited in winter time, solar energy has been used in water heating for nurseries, hospitals and families, according to reports . Forty participants from around the world attending the seminar will identify national projects to be involved within the framework of the world energy program aiming at developing solar energy in rural zone . He said Zimbabwe 's solar energy development infrastructure is at an advanced stage . A Japanese new energy research and development institute helped the power station as part of solar energy cooperative project between China and Japan to help China 's less-developed areas . The province has made marked progress in developing solar water heater, solar furnace, solar battery and basic theoretical research on the solar energy . Professor Xia Laifeng from Yunnan Teachers ' University, the solar energy research base in the province, said that they are studying the possibility of building `` solar energy houses, '' which use solar energy for heating and air conditioning, and
