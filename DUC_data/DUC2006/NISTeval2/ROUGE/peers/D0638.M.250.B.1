The weather on Jupiter seems always stormy.
Lightning flashes deep in the enveloping gas clouds.
Eddies of atmospheric turbulence bob along the margins of jet streams, feeding energy into titanic, long-lived whirlpools.
Thunderheads tower more than 30 miles above surrounding clouds, and new observations reveal that moist heat rising in these stormy updrafts probably supplies the energy driving most Jovian weather.
Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have concluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is similar to that on Earth _ only more so _ but is generated by heat from a completely different source: from deep in the planet, not from sunlight.
Other scientists said the new findings, reported in the current issue of the journal Nature, appeared to solve the mystery of how Jupiter gets the energy for such a constantly stormy weather system, although many questions remain unanswered.
A team of astronomers led by Dr. Peter J. Gierasch of Cornell University found the most telling evidence in images, from visible and infrared light, of the south equatorial belt, a region west of Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a seemingly permanent storm in the southern hemisphere.
Lightning was visible there before dawn.
A few hours later, a cluster of huge Earthlike storms developed there.
The scientists estimated that the vertical transport of heat by such storms corresponded to the flux generated by the planet's internal heat source.
