Reno has backed the INS determination that the boy be returned to his father in Cuba, and has said that Florida state courts have no say in the federal matter.

WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.

WASHINGTON _ The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
The boy was soon in the center of a campaign to bring him back to Cuba by his father and relatives in Cuba and to keep him in the United States by his relatives in Miami.
