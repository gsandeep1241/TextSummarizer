Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
He said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
The exact nature and rate of global climate change remains contentious.
"Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change," the study said.
Dudley said there exist possibilities of the destroying of the forests, because they cannot follow the rhythm of the rapid climate change.
Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat.
It said that the first impact of climate change will be felt in the Mediterranean water resource system.
A new report on global climate change released by Greenpeace said that as the seas warm up and glaciers melt, animals such as walruses seals, and caribous move north to colder temperatures.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
