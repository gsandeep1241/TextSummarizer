WASHINGTON -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development is taking steps to preserve thousands of federally subsidized housing units for the poor.
The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house.
Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself.
While Congress is projecting a budget surplus of as much as $100 billion for 1999, it will not be easy for the administration to get additional money for new programs.
The second program is expected to provide affordable housing for more than 17,000 low-income people with disabilities so that their rent does not exceed 30 percent of their income.
Under Lazio's law, the majority of units _ 65 percent _ in a public housing complex are allotted to residents who make up to 80 percent of an area's median income.
LIMAC, in turn, was affiliated with Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit that started in 1979 by lending foundation money at below-market rates for housing and community development.
On the thorniest issue, for instance _ how to bring more working families into public housing _ the proposed changes would pare back federal requirements for housing the very poor.
