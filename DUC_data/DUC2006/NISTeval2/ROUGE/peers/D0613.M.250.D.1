TRENTON, Ohio _ In a time when the nation's public schools are devoid of organized prayer, millions of students, teachers and parents bowed their heads Wednesday morning commemorating the annual ``See You at the Pole''.
In Trenton, more than 30 students, teachers and parents gathered at a flagpole outside of Edgewood High School to pray for spiritual guidance.
Generation X-ers put aside their backpacks and joined hands with their parents and teachers to make a ``visible (religious) stand'' just before the start of the school day.
The group prayed for classmates, faculty and teachers as well as for the well-being of the nation and a ``safe school year''.
Freshman Billy McClure said he attended the event ``to help everybody be a witness for God.`` ``Without prayer you don't get anywhere.
You got to pray everyday to keep you strong,'' McClure said.
Senior Janet Tannreuther said she attended in protest of new legislation that bans open religious expression during extracurricular activities including sporting events.
``(I came) to pray with my fellow students because they took away our right to pray at the football games,'' Tannreuther said.
``I thought that was wrong''.
``This event allows us to keep (children) focused upon God,'' said her brother Chris Tannreuther, standing a few feet away.
``He is the answer to all of our problems''.
Government teacher and parent Mike Mignery said the event allowed him to reflect upon legislative laws and freedom of expression.
``You have the right to freely practice your faith.
