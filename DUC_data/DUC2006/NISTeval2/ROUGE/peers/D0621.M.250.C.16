China urges Portugal to take steps against crime in Macau Gang headed by Hong Kong man broken up in China Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were from mainland China, Zhang said.
Just over half were arrested here on July 22; the rest were apprehended on July 29.
Still, many people believe the Chinese government will do a better job of snuffing out criminal activity, in part because it plans to station army troops in the territory.
Chinese courts have also dealt more harshly with suspected gang leaders than Portuguese courts.
China's Nationwide Crackdown on Crime Fruitful The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times.
Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs which entered China from overseas.
They also assisted police authorities of other countries in tracking down and arresting members of criminal gangs, he said.
Survey: China Serious about Public Security, Situation Disturbing-2 Statistics from the Ministry of Public Security say that in the first six months this year, police nationwide handled 833,000 criminal cases, up 21.6 percent over the same period last year.
The report on China's social situation said that although the Chinese government's position against corruption is firm, corruption, especially bribery, is still widespread and in some places severe.
