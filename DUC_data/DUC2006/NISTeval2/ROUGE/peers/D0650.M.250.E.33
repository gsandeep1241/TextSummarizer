Spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the delegation would not include former President Jimmy Carter, despite reports in local newspapers that Carter and four other former heads of state would be observers.
The hope is that the Carter Center will be able to work with Latin leaders and the international community to curtail bribery.
So it worked out nicely to confer the medals on the former president and his first lady at the Carter Center.
``The purpose of our mission is to assess the state of the electoral process, and to demonstrate by our presence and activities the confidence of the international community in the Mexican people's commitment to free and fair elections''.
The mission observers belong to the "Carter Center" group, which includes former presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and Osvaldo Hurtado of Ecuador.
According to Gordon Streeb, leader of the delegation, the former US president Jimmy Carter would lead a delegation of about 60 observers to Liberia as a reflection of the importance the center attaches to the success of the country's post-war elections.
The presence of Carter and his delegation to monitor the elections is also seen as part of efforts to enhance the credibility of the polls.
In a statement issued by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, he said his center and the U.S. National Democratic Institute for International Affairs would send a 40-to-50-member team to observe the February 27 presidential polls which would draw the curtain on the transfer of power from the military to civilians on
