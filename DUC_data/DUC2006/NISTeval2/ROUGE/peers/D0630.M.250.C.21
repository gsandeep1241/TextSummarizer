SMALL BOOKSELLERS TAKE FIGHT TO WEB Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites.

NEW YORK _ Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
"Online bookselling has had this extraordinary growth," Givler said, "but nobody knows how that is going to play out.
The chief executive of the online venture will remain Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes Noble, whose roots are in traditional bookselling.

"I felt like these were people who weren't in control of their fate any more".
Independent booksellers face tough times.
