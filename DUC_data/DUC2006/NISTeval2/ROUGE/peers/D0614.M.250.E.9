Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
The poll found that 92 percent of Canadians living outside Quebec believe the province's Aboriginal people have the right to stay with Canada in the event of a vote for independence.
But Acadians and their culture are alive and well in French-speaking New Brunswick, perfectly happy to remain part of Canada and deeply distrustful of the independence aspirations of their fellow Francophones in nearby Quebec.
In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when "winning conditions" exist.
The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols.
Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
MONTREAL _ With popular support for Quebec's independence in remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada made a bold gamble with his country's future last week, introducing legislation that lays out Canada's first road map for national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will never follow it.
