Nov. 26 -- Great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez granted temporary custody of Elian.
The developments came as the Jan. 14 deadline set by immigration officials for returning Elian to Cuba loomed.
Young-column _ Waco, Texas _ Judging from the inability thus far of the nation's cartoonists to get a bead on Bush, i wonder from where any enthusiasm comes.
Elian was found clinging to a rubber tube last Nov. 25 after the boat he, his mother, and several others used in their attempt to come to the United States capsized.
Castro's announcement came as a surprise primarily because Juan Gonzalez has said that he would go to the United States only after his son's case was resolved and the boy was ready to be taken back to Cuba.
The development came as negotiations between federal immigration officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse.
The development came after a hectic day in which Reno had first considered and then canceled plans to visit Miami.
The rush of events came after a failed attempt at a family conference late.
Before Reno arrived, o'Laughlin made brief remarks to the press, indicating that the family may be coming to grips with the likelihood of losing their long battle to keep Elian in the U.S. The court action could come at any time.
Come to think of it, they probably didn't.
Jihad is an unusual name for a Christian, but with war coming, it seemed appropriate.
