DUC 2006 Results of Secondary Automatic Evaluation
==================================================

After summaries were manually evaluated for DUC 2006, it was
discovered that there was a bug in the script for truncating the
automatic summaries that were submitted for evaluation; it was found
that a number of summaries had been erroneously truncated to fewer
than 250 words before being evaluated in the official manual
(Responsiveness, Linguistic Quality, Pyramid) and automatic (ROUGE,
BE) evaluations.

The file "length_adjustment.txt" lists the change in length (in words)
between the initial and correctly truncated summaries, for each
{runid,docset} affected by the bug in the truncation script.

This directory contains the results of running ROUGE/BE on the
correctly truncated summaries.  All other parameters are the same as
in the initial automatic evaluations.
