said Waltona Manion, a spokeswoman for the tribal alliance known as Californians for Indian Self-Reliance.</line><line>&quot;Why remove something that's working, and that's proven to have taken these tribes off of welfare dependency and put them on the road to self-sufficiency?&quot;</line><line>But Wilson has offered a clear alternative.</line><line>Last spring, he reached an agreement with the Pala Band of Mission Indians in San Diego County that would allow a new form of video slot machine but outlaw those now used by gambling tribes.</line><line>In the months since, 10 more tribes, some of them under threat of federal action, have signed the Pala compact, which limits each tribe to 199 of the new machines but allows them to lease rights for unused machines to other tribes, up to a maximum of 990 for any tribe, with a statewide cap of 19,900.</line><line>The State Legislature ratified the agreements in August.</line><line>Most of the gaming tribes contend that Wilson, who is barred from seeking a third term this year, refused to negotiate in good faith, as required by the 1988 federal law.</line><line>So Proposition 5 leaves little to chance, flatly requiring the state to grant a compact allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted them, though, as is now the case, the measure would only allow games in which players bet against a pool of other players' money, not against the casino house itself, as in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</line><line>Opponents of the measure contend that it is not needed to protect Indian gambling, and to hammer home the point, they are now running television advertisements featuring Paula Lorenzo, head of the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, which signed the Pala compact and is expanding its Cache Creek Casino 45 miles northwest of Sacramento.</line><line>&quot;We're doing all this without Prop.</line><line>5,&quot;

even among law enforcement officials.</line><line>Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Institute, an Indians' rights advocacy group in Washington, took an even more sweeping position, saying, &quot;This may actually represent a downturn in violence over the centuries since we first encountered Europeans.</line><line>&quot;At least it's not genocidal,&quot; said Ms. Harjo, who is part Cheyenee and part Muscogee.</line><line>&quot;Now they are taking Indians out one by one.&quot;</line><line>The study was published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical branch of the Justice Department, using data gathered from 1992 to 1996 by the National Crime Victimization Survey, which asks a sample of American households each year about crimes they have experienced.</line><line>The survey measures the violent crimes of rape, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault.</line><line>To supplement the survey, the justice department added data on homicides gathered by the FBI from local police reports.</line><line>The victimization survey is considered a reliable measure of crime by criminologists.</line><line>According to the survey, the average annual rate at which Indians were victims of crimes - 124 per 1,000 people, ages 12 or older - is about two and a half times the national average of 50 crimes per 1,000 people who are above the age of 12.</line><line>The average for whites was 49 per 1,000 people; for blacks, 61 per 1,000; and for Asians, 29 per 1,000.</line><line>Alcohol played a major part in violent crimes against Indians, both those committed by Indians against each other and those committed by people of other racial groups, the report found.</line><line>Indian victims reported that the perpetrator had been drinking in 46 percent of violent crimes against them, the highest of any racial group, while 70 percent of Indians convicted of violence who were in jail said they had been drinking at the time of their offense.</line><line>In addition, the survey found that the arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among Indians (including drunken driving, liquor law violations and public drunkenness) was more than double that for the total population during 1996, though the arrest rate for drug offenses was lower than for other races.</line><line>The four states with the most Indian residents were; Oklahoma, with 252,000, followed by California, Arizona and New Mexico.</line><line>Peter Iverson, a professor of history at Arizona State University, said that there had been a significant shift in Indian population over the past 20 years, with a majority of Indians now living in urban areas.</line><line>But those Indians in cities form a small part of the metropolitan area and do not live in segregated areas, so they are much more likely to come in contact with people of other groups.</line><line>Residential segregation is often part of the explanation for the tendency of whites to commit violence against whites, and blacks against other blacks.</line><line>Iverson said that in rural areas bordering Indian reservations, &quot;you still have significant prejudice against Indian people providing traditional justification for violence.&quot;<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="10"><scu uid="65" label="Violent crimes against Indians are often perpetrated by whites" weight="2"/></annotation></line><line>Historically, he said, Indians entered these communities to shop, or to buy alcohol or for entertainment, and though whites in these towns made money off the Indians, &quot;there has long been an uneasy relationship, even resentment.&quot;</line><line>In this situation, arguments, fueled by alcohol, could quickly become violent, he said.</line><line>Separately, the report said that the murder rate by Indians in 1996 was 4 per 100,000, below the national average of 7.9 per 100,000, and less than the white rate of 4.9 per 100,000.</line><line>From 1991 to 1996, the murder rate by Indians fell 20 percent, faster than the overall national decline of 15 percent.</line></document><document name="NYT19990315.0428"><line>BERNALILLO, N.M.</line><line>- With muscular yet elegant curves, the Rio Grande winds its way through the Santa Ana Pueblo reservation.</line><line>Stand along its yucca- and cactus-sprinkled shores and face north from the sacred Indian grounds where the Spanish explorer Coronado once trekked, and the Sandia Mountains seem to hang like gods in the sky to the east.</line><line>Look just to the west, and the only thing hanging in the sky is a giant neon star bearing the words &quot;Star Casino.&quot;</line><line>Next to the casino, little white golf carts zip over the reservation's 27-hole championship course.</line><line>And just beyond that, construction is under way on an $80 million hotel, a spa and second golf course.</line><line>After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their reservations.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="10,8"/></line><line>But as the easy-money aura of vacation resorts, gambling, golf, and shopping spreads across the land that these people have for generations cherished and protected from outside intrusion, concern is growing among tribal members that their religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside.</line><line>&quot;It's like a leisure virus,&quot;

said Otis Leon, a member of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe.</line><line>But the medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and culture, he added, &quot;are getting pushed aside in a way.&quot;</line><line>Leon, who voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed emotions.</line><line>&quot;Things seemed OK at first,&quot;

said Roy Montoya, who as chief administrator of the 690-member tribe is in charge of all business development.</line><line>&quot;What the new resort represents is another step toward self-sufficiency.&quot;</line><line>Within the tribe, where most decisions are made by councils comprised of men, the progression from subsistence agriculture to private business has created two camps.</line><line>The traditionalists are leery of opening their boundaries to outside interests, and the business leaders like Montoya are pushing to expand.</line><line>As the profits from gambling began to add up, &quot;we considered two approaches,&quot; Montoya said during an interview in his plain but comfortable office on the reservation.</line><line>&quot;Some people said stash the money.</line><line>Don't do anything with it.</line><line>But we chose to put these different ventures in place.&quot;</line><line>The culture and religion, Montoya says, will be strengthened by the economic growth.</line><line>&quot;Our culture and religion was very strong when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the reservation,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;Then when the economy started changing and Dad had to go off the reservation to work things got weak.</line><line>But with jobs on the reservation now you have more time to spend with your family and in 15 to 20 years the religion and culture will become stronger again.&quot;</line><line>The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning.</line><line>When the tribal council was discussing the proposed hotel, some members bristled at the notion of building the resort just a half mile from &quot;The Snake Head,&quot; one of the reservation's many ancient religious sites.</line><line>&quot;But the business types said they needed that site next to the river, overlooking the mountains,&quot; said Leon, whose grandfather held the revered religious title of medicine man.</line><line>The business interests prevailed.</line><line>As a result, Leon lamented: &quot;The religious people are upset with us.</line><line>They worry that the public will wander over the reservation.&quot;</line><line>One planned aspect of the Hyatt resort that might appease the religious leaders is a small museum with exhibits depicting the tribe's history.</line><line>Such museums are becoming a common element in casino and resort developments on reservations.</line><line>Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, located 70 miles north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders two weeks ago approved a plan to buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's existing casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's reservation.</line><line>But not everyone on the reservation is happy about the growth.</line><line>Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values and customs.</line><line>&quot;I've noticed a complete lack of participation in ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with diversions like the casino,&quot; he said.</line><line>Still, the benefits from all of the development are evident in the opportunities that have been created.</line><line>One recent afternoon at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member, was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across Highway 47 from the tribe's casino.</line><line>Although he has been playing golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap - better than most golfers will ever play - and the golf professionals operating the course have high hopes for him.</line><line>&quot;The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business enterprises and train their people,&quot; said Brent Townsley, a teaching professional at the course.</line><line>&quot;But our goal is to see someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro.&quot;</line><line>Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers, accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl around the reservation is unnerving to some.</line><line>&quot;They're taking a lot of the control of the economic development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe itself,&quot;

cannot begin to describe the overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy: the deserted roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and overgrown.</line><line>Every employer of any size has left, and new ones seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics - more than half the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to unwed mothers - and say no thanks.</line><line>Unspoken in most of those decisions is the knowledge that Hancock's population is 82 percent black, the highest percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in the nation.</line><line>Most of Georgia is prospering now, and the state's unemployment descended to a record low of 4.1 percent last month.</line><line>But only 80 miles from Atlanta's economic turbine, the jobless rate was 10.7 percent in Hancock County, and its per capita income of $15,390 is a third less than the rest of the state.</line><line>The county's leaders have begged for projects no one else wanted: poultry processing plants, a landfill, a waste incinerator.</line><line>Everything has fallen through except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's 9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire.</line><line>So it was probably inevitable, given how money is spent in the South these days, that Hancock County would place its hopes for an economic future on the ultimate last resort - an Indian gambling casino.</line><line>For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny Kialegee Indian tribe in Oklahoma expressed an interest in coming, county residents have talked of nothing else.</line><line>&quot;It's the last chance for our county,&quot;

said David Cournoyer, director of external affairs for the American Indian College Fund.</line><line>&quot;Before the philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically educate him to be a white person.</line><line>Now there's a recognition that the Indian's background and identity and self-esteem is important to them being good students.&quot;</line><line>Dr. David Beaulieu, the Education Department's director of Indian education, called the effort unprecedented.</line><line>&quot;We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children,&quot; Beaulieu said.</line><line>&quot;In the 1990s we had the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as existed 20 years before.&quot;.</line><line>In Nebraska, the efforts of Chessmore and others got the state to hold an Indian education summit meeting and appoint a task force to improve state policy.</line><line>The Legislature passed a bill this session changing the state aid formula so tribes, which have very little taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they cannot raise the required amount from property taxes.</line><line>The bill was vetoed by Nebraska's governor, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago school districts plan to sue the state.</line><line>Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Gov. Mike Johanns, said that while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill, he also believed &quot;it is time for the state and federal government to step up and do more, specifically in the area of funding.&quot;</line><line>And Nebraska's education commissioner, Doug Christensen, is hiring two staff members solely for Indian students: an education expert and a drug and alcohol counselor.</line><line>&quot;We're really courting disaster, I think, on those reservation communities,&quot; said Christensen.</line><line>&quot;In two of our reservation schools there are 44 kindergartners but only two seniors, and in one case those two kids should not be graduating.</line><line>They are two 18-year-old girls who couldn't pass the Algebra 1 test to save their soul.&quot;</line><line>Bob Geist, principal of the Winnebago reservation school, north of Macy, said &quot;some parents see formal education as important, others see just being with the family as education.</line><line>We have parents who will take kids out of school just to go shopping, or schedule a haircut in the middle of the day.&quot;</line><line>Parker, the Omaha Nation teacher who regularly sees only 15 out of 26 students in her largest class, sent her daughter to sixth grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa.</line><line>Recently, her daughter returned to Omaha Nation school to find she was &quot;way ahead of the sixth graders here,&quot; Parker said.</line><line>&quot;If I never would have sent her away, she never would have realized how hard she has to work.&quot;</line><line>Still, at Omaha Nation, Chessmore has made many improvements, from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help girls who have babies stay in school.</line><line>He started a training program for Indian teachers that will increase their numbers from 4 to 20, made the curriculum more culturally relevant, and has applied for money for a social services center with probation officers and a mental health counselor.</line><line>He received a grant for a reading program for elementary students, which has produced &quot;fourth graders who are reading better than half our high school.&quot;</line><line>And he is lobbying the telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students' families without them.</line><line>To build trust, Chessmore, unlike most superintendents and teachers in reservation schools, enrolled his seven children at Omaha Nation, the only non-Indians among the 470 students.</line><line>He and his wife also raise four Indian students from troubled families.</line><line>He hired three truant officers, and the truancy rate fell from 31 percent to about 15 percent.</line><line>One afternoon, Waylon Oldman, a truant officer and tribe member, scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school.</line><line>In a Buick with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants, Oldman visited one boy's father and the trailer where the other boy lived with his grandmother.</line><line>He scaled a chalky ridge called Million Dollar Hill, poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees, scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge, and combed an algae-choked creek strewn with old tires..</line><line>The truants were nowhere to be seen.</line><line>&quot;The kids are smart - they arrange tree branches so they can scoot underneath but we have to work to get through,&quot; Oldman said.</line><line>He said tribal court has begun fining parents whose children were chronically truant, and the school sometimes tried to get their welfare benefits cut.</line><line>&quot;Some parents are really concerned, but some of the parents don't really understand why they need to send the kids to school.&quot;</line><line>One chronic truant was JaniceBaxter's 16-year-old son.</line><line>She would take him to school in the morning, but said that &quot;in the afternoon, I would see him walking around with friends.&quot;</line><line>Baxter said he kept &quot;coming home drunk&quot; and she sent him to a treatment center.</line><line>Some students show promise but don't follow through.</line><line>This year, it looked like Jason Miller, a senior on the basketball team, would graduate, but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season ended.</line><line>&quot;I didn't really want to come to school no more,&quot; said Jason, 18.</line><line>But there have been successes.</line><line>One senior, Liz Parker, had slacked off too badly to graduate.</line><line>But a few weeks ago, Chessmore refused to let his daughter double date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate.</line><line>She did.</line><line>And Adrienne Miller, 19, who was left back in ninth grade and was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks, turned things around under pressure from her mother, who told her she would have to help pay the bills if she wasn't in school.</line><line>Now she'll graduate and plans to attend college.</line><line>&quot;I finally realized what I should be doing,&quot;
