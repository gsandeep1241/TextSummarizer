pampering.</line><line>That's why people pay $10,000 round-trip for the abbreviated experience.</line><line>The sleek, needle-nosed aircraft cross the Atlantic at an altitude of 60,000 feet and at

who flies it frequently.</line><line>&quot;You can leave London at 10 and be in New York at 9.&quot;</line><line>The quick flight time leaves little room to settle in and watch a movie -- which is fortunate, because Concorde's stringent weight restrictions leave no room for video equipment.</line><line>There are no headphones, either, and the planes -- whose average age is more than 23 years -- are so old they do not have telephones, to the consternation of some business travelers.</line><line>But there are compensations, including an unending stream of gourmet food and drink, served on crystal, china and linen.</line><line>Food critic Egon Ronay described the service on the British Airways Concorde as &quot;oozing luxury and refinement&quot; -- and, apparently, alcohol.</line><line>One passenger was told that hand luggage was restricted onboard because extra space was needed for the wine cellar.</line><line>Contrary to popular imagination, however, the supersonic journeys are almost as cramped as regular flights -- partly the result of weight restrictions that would not apply in a bigger aircraft.</line><line>&quot;It's not the normal first-class service.</line><line>It's pretty cramped inside, but it's viewed as a time saver.</line><line>It's not viewed as luxurious an option as a first-class seat on a 747,&quot; said Mike Stoddart, a transport analyst for Charterhouse Securities, a London-based brokerage firm.</line><line>Indeed, Philippe Gossard, a Paris-based aviation analyst for the investment bank Credit Lyonnais Securities, said many business travelers prefer to fly from Europe to the United States on Concorde to save time, then return to Europe in the evening in first class on a 747 so they can stretch out on an in-flight bed.</line><line>Recognizing the supersonic jet might be losing ground, British Airways -- which operates seven Concordes -- announced earlier this year that it would spend millions of dollars to make the plane's interiors brighter, the toilets bigger and the corresponding airport lounges more luxurious.</line><line>For pilots, flying a Concorde, which first took wing in 1969, can be the pinnacle of their careers.</line><line>&quot;It's a beautiful airplane to fly, it's a responsive, thoroughbred of an aircraft,&quot; John Hutchinson, who flew it for British Airways for 15 years, told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday.</line><line>But some passengers find their first experience of supersonic travel unsettling, describing takeoff as seemingly vertical and the resulting G-forces more than a little daunting.</line><line>&quot;You are just thrust back into your seats,&quot; said Colin Frith, 50, who received a two-hour Concorde flight around Britain as a birthday present.</line><line>Another passenger said landing felt like someone had slammed on the brakes in midair.</line><line>Until Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris, at least, passengers could feel they were paying for peace of mind.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="3" sums="15,22,8"><scu uid="252" label="The Concorde crash occurred near Paris."

the extent that French civilization is available to others.</line><line>In 1955 Roland Barthes wrote that cars were the precise modern equivalent of the great Gothic cathedrals: &quot;I mean the

says that the one thing she truly enjoys about having money is that it makes traveling easier.</line><line>Mass travel, in other words, is what gravity used to be in the early days of flight: an oppressive condition from which only the privileged manage to escape.</line><line>Yet the Concorde has long been trailed by a whiff of morbidity.</line><line>Until last week the plane's safety record had been impeccable.</line><line>But its status as a cultural icon was always fragile.</line><line>When the United States canceled its program to develop supersonic transport for civilians, the British-French endeavor was left without competition and the benefits that accrue from it.</line><line>It is not always so great to be the only game in town.</line><line>Without competition there was no incentive to update the aircraft and none of the improvements that succeeding generations of supersonic craft might have developed.</line><line>As a result Concorde pilots must use their brains to operate controls that on newer subsonic jets are run by computer.</line><line>Who knows whether more advanced controls would have alerted the pilots last Monday to the flames shooting out of the engines?</line><line>Or whether advanced technology could have reduced noise, increased head room, extended the range of flights or eventually brought down fares?</line><line>The craft's obsolescence was thus virtually guaranteed before the first flight took off.</line><line>In this the Concorde resembles the Queen Elizabeth 2, which began trans-Atlantic service in the summer of

outer skin, would probably be more expensive than even such enormous fares could justify.</line><line>Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour, Concorde was largely restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic boom on earthlings.</line><line>But at subsonic speeds, especially during takeoffs, the roar of its jet engines and after-burners made conventional jets sound like

drill.</line><line>But questions began to be raised as to whether the pilot had unwittingly made a crucial mistake: Told by his navigator that Engine No. 2 was malfunctioning and by the tower that flames were shooting out, he apparently assumed Engine No. 2 was on fire and ordered it cut off.</line><line>Meanwhile, perhaps not knowing it, he was losing power in Engine No. 1, next to it.</line><line>That may have left the plane with too little thrust to fly.</line><line>Investigators later found no marks of fire in either engine; only the wing and fuselage were scorched.</line><line>Friday's preliminary report carefully does not criticize any decision made that day.</line><line>&quot;The crew,&quot; it notes, &quot;had no way of knowing the nature of the fire nor of fighting against it.&quot;</line><line>But Le Monde, the Paris daily, asked: &quot;What would have happened if he had kept Engine No. 2 working?</line><line>It's impossible to say whether the crash could have been avoided.&quot;</line><line>And the author of the article, Michel Alberganti, said a careful analysis of the transcript and report led him to the conclusion that &quot;it was the wrong decision&quot; but understandable given what the pilot was told.</line><line>It is hard to tell from the transcript exactly what the crew knew.</line><line>They did not remark aloud on Engine No. 1.</line><line>One of the plane's black boxes indicated later that its power decreased, increased, then decreased again, for unknown reasons.</line><line>After the pilot ordered power cut to No. 2, he was distracted by the landing gear's failure to retract.</line><line>Meanwhile, the co-pilot kept drawing attention to the airspeed indicator.</line><line>While those decisions were being made on July 25 in the 77 seconds between 4:43:13 p.m., when the controller spotted the fire, and 4:44:30, when the last sound was recorded, amateur photographers on the highways below were capturing

the wreckage.</line><line>&quot;Just imagine what people going on a cruise on an ocean liner would take with them,&quot; a spokesman for the Air Transport Police was quoted as saying.</line><line>The
