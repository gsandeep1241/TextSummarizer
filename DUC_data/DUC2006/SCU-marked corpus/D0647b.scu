settled into an uneasy calm, the battle over six-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez moved to court Friday with the boy's Miami relatives hoping to overturn a decision by federal immigration officials to send him back to his father in Cuba.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="4" sums="03,24,28,32"/></line><line>The high-profile case also drew attention in Washington, where Cuban-American members of Congress discussed strategies for keeping the boy here through legislative action, even as President Clinton confirmed his support for the decision that Elian should go back to Cuba.</line><line>&quot;I believe they followed the law,&quot; Clinton said of officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who ruled the boy belongs with his father.</line><line>&quot;This is a volatile and difficult case. ...</line><line>We need to keep this out of the political process as much as possible.&quot;</line><line>In Miami, the biggest news for many residents was the absence of a new round of protests like the ones that hampered traffic around the city on Thursday.</line><line>Police arrested more than 100 people in those demonstrations, which temporarily blocked the street entrance to the Port of Miami and triggered some bloody scuffles between officers and protestors.</line><line>Cuban exile leaders had called for people all over Miami-Dade County to drive at 15 mph Friday to tie up traffic.</line><line>By late in the day, however, there were only a couple of reports of such actions, which police quickly quelled by pulling over and arresting the slow-moving drivers.</line><line>Undaunted, activists called for a day-long slowdown Monday at Miami International Airport, hoping to win more media attention for their cause.</line><line>Airport officials said they would be ready with teams of police and tow trucks to stop any attempts to block traffic.</line><line>&quot;We will not let the airport be shut down,&quot; said the airport's director, Carlos Alvarez.</line><line>&quot;We will take whatever steps are necessary to keep the airport open.&quot;</line><line>The developments came as the Jan. 14 deadline set by immigration officials for returning Elian to Cuba loomed.</line><line>The boy, who survived a boat capsizing that killed his mother and nine others on Thanksgiving Day, played with a puppy outside the Little Havana home of his relatives Friday, seemingly oblivious to the horde of media camped out on a nearby street.</line><line>In Cuba, residents of his hometown, Cardenas, held a massive rally, decrying U.S. imperialism and the delays in Elian's return.</line><line>His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, appeared, saying he has no plans to travel to Miami, as his relatives here have requested.</line><line>&quot;I deeply appreciate all the people all over the world who have come together to condemn the psychological torture we're being put through,&quot; he said.</line><line>As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, asking for temporary custody of the boy.<annotation scu-count="1"

law.</line><line>It was unclear what the impact of possible congressional action on the case might be.</line><line>Cuban-American representatives from South Florida asked House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., to issue a subpoena requiring the boy to testify before his committee, a move that would bar Elian from leaving this country.</line><line>Burton said he would seriously consider the subpoena.</line><line>Meanwhile, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he will continue to push for an act of Congress that would declare the boy a U.S. citizen, thereby changing his immigration status.</line><line>With events moving forward on several fronts, it appears the battle over the boy is far from over.</line><line>Even as his father spoke in Cuba, thanking Fidel Castro for his support, Elian's Miami relatives claimed in court papers that going back to Cuba would amount to psychological abuse for the boy.</line><line>&quot;Elian has repeatedly stated that he does not want to return to Cuba,&quot;

panel had upheld the US Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to allow an asylum hearing for Elian, saying only the child's father could make such a request.</line><line>The relatives' sole remaining opportunity for an appeal is to the US Supreme Court.</line><line>But the justices in Washington are widely seen as unlikely to accept the case if they are asked to do so, both because there is no indication of previous judicial error and because the three-judge panel cited a Supreme Court ruling as the rationale for its own decision.</line><line>Analysts said the only surprise about Friday's seemingly conclusive announcement from Atlanta was that it had taken so long to reach.</line><line>&quot;It feels like it's been forever getting here, but it's absolutely the right decision,&quot; said Karen Jacobsen, a specialist in refugee and immigration policy at the Fletcher School of International Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.</line><line>&quot;It's in keeping with American law and immigration policy. . .and it's in keeping with what most people believe about families: that a child belongs with his parent, and not with people he hardly knows.&quot;</line><line>The 12 judges of the 11th Circuit evidently shared with many observers of the case the feeling that it was time to write the last chapter of a saga that has captivated the nation and sparked international controversy since Elian was discovered floating on an inner tube off the Florida coast last November.</line><line>He had survived, with two others, a disastrous boat

Washington.</line><line>&quot;Now that the court has conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able to move on with their lives together.&quot;</line><line>Greg Craig, the attorney for Elian's father, released a short statement that relayed the same sentiments.</line><line>It said, in part:.</line><line>&quot;We believe that the INS decision to recognize the right of Juan Miguel Gonzalez to speak for his son Elian is consistent with the rule of law and our nation's core values and traditions.</line><line>We are gratified that the 11th Circuit was unanimous in its decision to affirm those values and those traditions.&quot;</line><line>Craig added that the elder Miguel and his family, who have been living in suburban Washington awaiting a final disposition of the case, &quot;look forward to resuming a normal life.&quot;</line><line>Elian has been in his father's custody since April 22, when federal agents forcibly removed him from the home of his great uncle and cousins in the Little Havana section of Miami.</line><line>His relatives, who have lost every judicial decision in their effort to prevent his return to Cuba, had argued that all 12 judges on the 11th Circuit should rehear the case because the three-judge panel drawn from their ranks had erred in its ruling.</line><line>But the full court adamantly
