. BRAZELTON : The diagnosis of ADHD _ Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder _ does n't occur to me. Madras, a professor of biopsychology at the medical school, said the test showed that the seven adults diagnosed with attention deficit disorder had on average a 70 percent elevation in concentrations of a brain protein called the dopamine transporter . The most common form among boys is known as Type B. Rather than flightiness, persons with this form tend to be hyperactive and impulsive . Such a test would go far to resolve a continuing and intense dispute about whether stimulant medications like Ritalin are being overprescribed as a treatment for ADHD.
The academy said it believes the new guidelines will standardize the diagnosis and make it easier to identify which children really need help . '' ADHD is a serious condition, and parents who are concerned about it should talk to their children ' s doctors about appropriate treatment, '' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC ' s Bureau of Consumer Protection . A pediatrician diagnosed Kyle with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and prescribed a trial run of Ritalin . Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving . Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz .
