Nearly 6,000 workers went on strike at a General Motors spark plug and speedometer factory in Flint, Mich., joining fellow strikers at a nearby GM plant in an increasingly bitter fight that could close all of the leading automaker's North American assembly plants within days.
Last summer's strikes at two parts plants in Flint lasted several weeks and cost GM about 2 billion while they idled nearly 200,000 GM workers and thousands of employees at independent suppliers.
Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, warned in a telephone interview that GM should not count on Canadian worker willingness to accept parts produced by equipment taken out of the Flint factory.
With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal since the 1950s.
The United Auto Workers reached tentative agreements with General Motors Corp. and its former parts division Tuesday on contacts covering about 185,000 workers.
The deal came after two days of intensive talks involving UAW President Stephen P. Yokich and GM Chairman Jack Smith.
The dispute forced GM to shut down 27 of 29 North American assembly plants and cost the automaker close to 3 billion.
In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two dozen Delphi plants, Delphi managers have told workers that the union is demanding that GM close its Mexican plants
