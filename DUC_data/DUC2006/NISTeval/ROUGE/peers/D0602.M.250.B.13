The temptation is becoming too great for some female athletes to resist.
Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned strength-builders.
It made it a banner year for an issue far more serious and potentially devastating : athletes using performance-enhancing substances to build bigger and stronger bodies.
While McGwire will go down in the history books as the unqualified home run champion for a single season, other athletes who used similar substances faced far different repercussions.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
EPO is a significant performance enhancer for endurance athletes, such as five Tour de France bicyclists who disqualified themselves by admitting use of the banned substance.
Experts who study the effects of synthetic anabolic steroids are encouraged, for two distinctly different reasons, that two new trials of their use show a benefit for two groups of very sick people.
Dr. Gary Wadler, an anabolic-steroid authority at New York University Medical Center, points out that the first widespread use of the drug came for people who were wasting away from illnesses or injuries suffered in the war or in concentration camps.
In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that
