While the UN and a number of non-governmental organizations are calling for drastic global action to reduce climate change, major industries in some countries are urging their governments to take a go-slow approach, arguing against steps they say could cost jobs and growth before the problem is better understood.
The insurers called on countries to take precautionary actions to reduce the risks of climate change.
Governments and international organizations ``have to stop hitting the snooze button on the alarm bell for action that global warming represents,'' said Adam Markham, director of the WWF's Global Climate Change Campaign.
The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming.
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that ``as long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming will occur and occasion changes in the climate system.'' The report estimates that some species of vegetation would have to migrate 10 times faster than during the last glacial retreat, about 10,000 years ago.
Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
