French investigators looking into the crash of an Air France Concorde said it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.

Only 20 of the planes were built, and just 13 of those were still in service, seven with British Air and six with Air France, which grounded its planes immediately after the accident.

French investigators believe the strip shredded one of the Concorde's tires, sending huge chunks of rubber through the jet's fuel tanks.
Forensic experts finished identifying the remains of all 113 victims of the Concorde crash.
The technical investigation into the crash is going quickly, Gilles Ricono, the top aide to Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot.
