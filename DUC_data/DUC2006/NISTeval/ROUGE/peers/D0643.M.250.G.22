The meeting will provide scientific and technical information on the current status of El Nino, as one of the major forces acting on the global climate system and with a potential to affect weather patterns in many areas of the globe.
El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
Because of its association with monsoon rains in south Asia, ``La Nina's impacts in that region are typically viewed as less disruptive than those of El Nino,'' the WMO report said.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects wind and temperature patterns.
In 1998El Nino's effects on the world came into full flower.
The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance.
Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
Checkley said the stronger effect in winter could be due to the fact that the types of diarrhea common in winter and summer are different.
El Nino expected later this year or early next year: experts.
