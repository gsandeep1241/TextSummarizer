El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns in usually wet locales and flooding.
"It has become imperative in the backdrop of past performance of El Nino," the weather expert said.
The El Nino weather phenomenon produced more benefits for the United States.
"If we can predict a change in the weather, such as when El Nino cycles around, we could have all the interventions in place before the weather changes.".
The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events.
That might make it possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in years without a big El Nino.
Like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning.
Strong warm episode (El Nino) conditions have persisted in the tropical Pacific.
Studies have disagreed on whether the warming would produce the El-Nino-like Pacific surface temperatures.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean.
Has been unusual, with a growing La Nina sharing the ocean with remnants of the strongest El Nino.
`It's really a question at this point: Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers''? he said.
