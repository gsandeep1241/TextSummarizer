La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance.
The findings by a team of researchers add to a growing body of knowledge about the still mysterious El Nino, which has affected weather systems from South America to the U.S. Northeast.
The findings could add to research into how El Nino may have influenced civilization, and what it could mean for the future of a warming planet.
Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer study suggests.
The Four Corners TV program claimed scientific data were showing that a man-made permanent drought was in the offing as a result of global warming.
Studies suggest tornadoes were reduced by as much as 24 percent in some regions during the most recent El Nino.
While El Nino's effects have recognized for years, scientists until now have had only a few hundred years worth of written and anecdotal records to study, including when it began.
The core gives what scientists say is the longest continuous record of El Nino activity.
