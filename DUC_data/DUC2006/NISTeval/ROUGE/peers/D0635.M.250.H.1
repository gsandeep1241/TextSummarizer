AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush gets criticized for his hands-off approach to state executions, but state law leaves little room for governors to act in these life-and-death decisions.
Supporters say Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, allows the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to do its job freely by maintaining an arm's-length relationship.
''The governor leaves it up to each parole board member to make their own decisions after they review the case.
They're an independent body,'' said Bush spokesman Mike Jones.
Others contend that Bush does direct the board -- through his public statements on executions and his power to appoint members to their six-year, $80,000-per-year jobs.
All current board members are Bush appointees.
''It does seem that they would want to be in line with his way of thinking about it,'' said Richard C. Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
Bush has said he supports the death penalty and doesn't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration.
But David Dow, a University of Houston law professor who represents condemned inmates, suggests both Bush and his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, have used the parole board ''as an excuse to avoid having to make a tough, moral decision''.
In Texas, the governor can only issue a one-time, 30-day reprieve or act on a recommendation of the parole board to grant a stay, commute a sentence or issue a pardon.
