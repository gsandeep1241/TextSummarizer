New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.
These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable decline of violent crime in New York.
The rate of violent crimes fell 4 percent, helping to push down the overall U.S. crime rate.
The property crime rate in Rhudy's division declined 8.4 percent, while violent crimes rose 13.2 percent.
`I think our crime rate would decline even further if we spent more time on the curfew,'' Wahler said.
Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in the nation's crack cocaine problem.
Nearly 90 percent of the people locked up for crack under federal drug laws are black.
The crime rate might not be so low if the state had not locked up so many drug offenders.
As the state added 21 prisons and only one university campus _ violent criminals fell to 42 percent of the prison population, from 57 percent, while drug inmates grew to 27 percent, from 8 percent.
This rate of increase was greater than it was the year before, but significantly less than the 5 percent increase in the state's prison population.
44 percent of last year's violent crimes against people were reported to police, compared.
Murder and other serious crimes dropped for an eighth consecutive year in, by far the longest-running crime decline.
Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders charged with federal crimes.
