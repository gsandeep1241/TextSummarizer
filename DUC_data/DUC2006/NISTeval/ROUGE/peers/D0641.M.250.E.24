Greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century.
Greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-sponsored network of more than 2,000 scientists monitoring the global climate, has concluded that there is a "discernible human influence" on the climate through the burning of fossil fuels, which produce greenhouse gases.
"Global warming won't be a simple warming of the Earth.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
"The data suggest that global warming has caused a slowdown of the Earth at a rate of 0.56 milliseconds a century.
The mainstream view, based on computerized simulations of the climate system, is that a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations would produce a warming of about 3 to 8 degrees.
