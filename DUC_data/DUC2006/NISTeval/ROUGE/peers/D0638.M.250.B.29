Spacecraft Galileo will close in on Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede early morning to gather the most detailed information ever obtained about the icy satellite, according to a NASA report.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
Galileo took measurements of Europa's magnetic field during a Jan. 3 flyby 218 miles above the moon.
Ever since a Voyager spacecraft flew by Europa in 1979, scientists have entertained the intriguing possibility of a global ocean below its surface.
As part of an extended mission, Galileo's instruments are studying the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic properties of Io, Jupiter's innermost large moon and the only known actively volcanic solar system object besides Earth.
Only in or near the volcano vents is the moon's surface warm.
A report in the current issue of the journal Nature describes how Jupiter's intense radiation could provide all the energy necessary for chemical reactions to create and maintain living organisms in a subsurface ocean, if one exists at Europa.
Meanwhile, the space agency has agreed in principle to continue Galileo's operations past Jan. 31, when its current mission was to end.
The water layer might be sandwiched between a radioactively heated interior, where convection keeps the material mixed, and a thin icy shell, where a different convection cycle cools the ocean.
