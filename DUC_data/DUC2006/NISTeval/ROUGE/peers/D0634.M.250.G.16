``Chinook,'' Mensik said, identifying it as a member of the heftiest of the salmon species.
If it lives long enough, the juvenile smolt, as it is called, could grow to 3 or 4 feet and 40 pounds or more.
Locke agreed, calling salmon ``the very definition of the Pacific Northwest.'' ``Researchers predict that anticipated increases in water temperature caused by a double of carbon dioxide will eliminate most, if not all, suitable habitat for Pacific sockeye salmon, and possibly for other salmon species as well,'' the report says.
The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest.
''That allows them to continue to list coho salmon as a threatened species, which in turn allows them to continue to regulate.
In that regulation they control land use and resources.
That's what it is, is a land grab.'' _All species: The plan governs all species of salmon and steelhead, from the relatively healthy sockeye salmon runs of Lake Osoyoos and Lake Wenatchee to the endangered spring chinook salmon.
But the ESA does not extend the penalties to 263 threatened species, including many of the listed salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest.
(Threatened species are defined as likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.) But Griffin said the Fisheries Service's decision should not have been a surprise.
The agency calls for penalties in most rules it promulgates for threatened species, he said.
