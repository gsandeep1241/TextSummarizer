Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
Those gases trap heat, and although there is ongoing dispute about how that in turn affects the climate, there is no doubt that global temperatures are rising.
The scientists said that the warming effect, especially rising temperatures in winter, will result in a series of changes to nature and human society.
The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in temperatures but by also favoring certain established weather patterns.
Two big questions complicate efforts to predict the course of the earth's climate over the next century: How sensitive is the climate system, inherently, to the warming effect of greenhouse gases?
The cloud -- a harbinger of climate change, some call it -- appears as global warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields ranging from atmospheric physics to biology.
Over the years, skeptics have tried to cast doubt on the idea of global warming by noting that measurements taken by earth satellites since 1979 have found little or no temperature rise in large parts of the upper atmosphere.
The satellites' all-encompassing coverage yields more reliable results than temperature samplings showing a century-long warming trend at the earth's surface, they argued.
