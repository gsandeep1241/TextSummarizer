All species: The plan governs all species of salmon and steelhead, from the relatively healthy sockeye salmon runs of Lake Osoyoos and Lake Wenatchee to the endangered spring chinook salmon.
The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest.
Pacific salmon are different from Atlantic salmon in that there are several species, and that different populations spawn at different times.
The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act.
More salmon are collected at two other dams on the Snake and one on the Columbia.
The Pacific Salmon treaty was first negotiated in 1985 to divide the salmon catch between U.S. and Canadian fishermen based on how many fish were spawned in each country.
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.
In all, Clinton is proposing $290 million for salmon conservation programs in the West and Pacific Northwest.
That includes $91 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Columbia-Snake river system; $60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada; and $39 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service's salmon recovery efforts.
