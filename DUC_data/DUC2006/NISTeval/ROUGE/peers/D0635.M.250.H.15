Austin, Texas _ George W. Bush is proud to call himself ``the law-and-order governor.''.
`There have been so many executions in Texas, I doubt that George Bush even knows half of their names.''.
Since Bush took office in January 1995, Texas has sent 116 inmates to Huntsville's death chamber.
Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.
Bush has said he supports the death penalty and doesn't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration.
The parole board recommended Lucas' sentence to life in prison, and Bush approved it in June 1998.
Under Texas law, Bush can accept or veto board recommendations to pardon Graham or commute his sentence.
A governor may commute a death sentence or grant clemency only upon the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
As governor, Bush's only independent authority is to grant a 30-day reprieve of an execution.
The governor does have the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve in death penalty cases, but Graham had already received one in 1993 from Bush's predecessor.
`Governor Bush's decision will make our death penalty punishment stronger than ever,'' said Mattox.
`The death penalty is in the dock,'' and ``capital punishment in Texas is in the cross hairs this political season.''.
They want to embarrass Bush and halt capital punishment by exposing flaws in the Texas system.
