Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife and their son arrive in the United States.
These columns for release Friday, January 14, 2000 are moving today to clients of the New York Times News Service.
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded his parental rights as the child's sole surviving parent.
After the child was rescued on Nov. 25, he became the subject of an international custody dispute between his father in Cuba and their relatives in the United States, who fought unsuccessfully all the way to the Supreme Court to block his repatriation.
State television reported Friday night that Elian had received his first-grade diploma after a special effort by teachers to help him recover the time lost during his tumultuous stay in the United States.
In Miami, Sen. Smith, R-N.H.
, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has INS oversight, met with the boy's relatives.
The boy's Miami relatives were given temporary custody of Elian, who immediately became the subject of an international tug-of-war.
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group sang of his mother, who was lost at sea.
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year from a shipwreck after his mother and 10 others were killed when their boat capsized in the Atlantic.
But under the ruling, Elian must remain in the United States for 14 days to give his Miami relatives a chance to appeal.
