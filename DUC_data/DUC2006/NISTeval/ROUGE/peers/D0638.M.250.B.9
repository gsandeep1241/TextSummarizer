Otherwise, Galileo's agenda is not clear, pending a NASA decision on whether to go ahead with a full 14-month extension called the Galileo Millennium Mission.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
Kivelson said that if the full Galileo mission extension was approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this same type of phenomenon occurred on Ganymede, which is the largest moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet Mercury.
New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled.
From Europa's surface, Jupiter would appear as a huge, dark body in a mostly black sky, said Gerald Schubert a planetary physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an interdisciplinary scientist on the Galileo mission.
