Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on South African weather, and that forecasts for dry conditions from November to March were correct.
Nearly two thirds of the 58 counties of California have been declared as federal disaster zones due to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino's would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time, said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate Prediction Center.
The surface of the Pacific Ocean is expected to continue cooling slowly for the rest of the year, fueling the La Nina weather phenomenon, the U.N. weather agency said Monday.
Weak La Nina conditions have started to develop, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in its El Nino/La Nina Update.
Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer study suggests.
