La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west.
An f-5 is the most powerful tornado there is.
La Ninas sometimes occur between El Ninos.
In fact, the effect was greater in winter, even though the weather was cooler.
Checkley said the stronger effect in winter could be due to the fact that the types of diarrhea common in winter and summer are different.
Just twoNational Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina -- a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino's -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
What was predicted to be a minor event, as one forecaster concedes and television viewers may recall, turned out to be a ``whopper.
The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance.
From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from 1915 to 1950 they were minuscule.
For example, the El Nino that formed in 1997 and boosted global temperatures to record highs was unanticipated, as was its intensity.
There are signs that this may not always be the case.
Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on South African weather, and that earlier forecasts for dry conditions from to were correct.
