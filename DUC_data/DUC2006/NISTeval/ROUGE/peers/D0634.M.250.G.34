Now there's a crash test salmon.
The fake fish will spurt through the churning, 10-foot-long blades of the McNary hydropower dam on the Washington-Oregon border next month to measure how salmon are jostled, scraped and even killed on their treacherous journey downstream.
``The idea is to document with data what fish experience,'' said George Hecker, president of Alden Research Laboratory Inc. in Holden, Mass.
The synthetic salmon was developed at the Department of Energy's Richland, Wash., lab as part of a five-year, $8 million government effort to make hydropower dams more fish friendly.
It has been tested with a sledgehammer, a lighted candle and intense water pressure, said Bennie Rinehart, an engineer with Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Co., which helped finance the project.
But even a harsh critic of government salmon efforts, Justin Hayes of American Rivers, said it may have something useful in Flubber.
SACRAMENTO _ Government officials, conservation groups and private landowners announced an ambitious plan to revive California's beleaguered salmon fisheries Monday, claiming it points to a new era of environmental restoration.
Under the pact, five Pacific Gas and Electric Co. power-generating dams will be removed on Battle Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River east of Red Bluff that supports endangered salmon and steelhead trout.
Three other dams will be retrofitted with fish ladders, and the volume of downriver flows will be increased tenfold.
Because it is a pristine watercourse fed year-round by cold, subterranean springs, Battle Creek is one of the finest salmon
