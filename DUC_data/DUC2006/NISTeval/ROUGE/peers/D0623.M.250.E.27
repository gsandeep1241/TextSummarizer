CHINA: With 320 million smokers, smoking is the closest thing China has to a national pastime.
Many big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing municipalities, and Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an and other cities took similar measures after Changzhi of north China's Shanxi Province initiated the no-smoking law in November, 1989.
The smoking bans of these places mainly cover public transportation facilities, schools, cinemas, theaters, meeting halls, hospitals, department stores, museums, stadiums, and so on.
Lighting up in the Forbidden City, on a subway train, or other very public places can risk a small fine, perhaps 60 cents to dlrs 1.20 (5 to 10 yuan), but generally the 1996 ban on smoking in public places is ignored.
DENMARK: Although smoking is banned in hospitals, public transportation and shops, Danes can still have a puff in Copenhagen cafes and restaurants so long as they don't bother others.
Most offices have a smoking room and, if colleagues don't mind, smokers can light up at their desks.
In smoker-friendly Montreal, provincial legislation in the works would outlaw smoking in most public places and require restaurants to allocate at least 60 percent of their seats to nonsmokers.
More than 30 "no-smoking" signs have been placed inside buildings of the Municipal People's Congress, the local legislative body, since it passed the ban last December.
Cigarettes were banned from all offices and meeting rooms of the MPC as soon as it published news of the regulation.
