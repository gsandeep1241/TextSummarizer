Tuesday, administration officials said the pharmaceutical plant was not the only installation in Sudan suspected of producing chemicals for VX, but rather the one where the United States had the most persuasive evidence.
It seemed possible that the pharmaceutical factory was not actually making the ``precursor chemical'' that the administration described, the diplomats here said.
Clinton's focus was on the presence at the plant of Empta, a precursor chemical used to make VX, a deadly nerve gas, the spokesman said.
The officials declined to name the chemical, which the administration has classified, but they said it had no other known use that would explain its presence in the plant, called the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co.
But the Iraqis would be hard-pressed to explain what the chemicals were doing on warheads that Iraq said contained other substances.
There would be no viable explanation for the presence of that chemical, they said, other than the production of VX.
The only thing you can use it for, that we know of, is to make VX," a senior U.S. intelligence official said.
Soil sample from the plant site showed traces of EMPTA, a manmade chemical that has no commercial uses and is a key ingredient in the deadly nerve agent VX, U.S. intelligence officials said.
Philip Reeker said Empta, used to make chemical weapons, was found outside the al-Shifa facility.
That is unlike chemicals on Schedule 1, which are deemed to have no other use than to kill people and are strictly prohibited.
