There are many reasons that American families turn to international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle foster care. In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different : it is for parents . Gallagher, who has used her own money to set up the program and for travel, has a local adoption agency called Adoption Advocates Inc. as the international license holder . and among adoption practitioners throughout the United States --- stems from a series of new laws in Russia that promise to radically alter adoption practices within that country and, as a result, possibly change the face of international adoption . At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents . Brownback said that could happen largely because an American central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current international adoption process .

Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier .
