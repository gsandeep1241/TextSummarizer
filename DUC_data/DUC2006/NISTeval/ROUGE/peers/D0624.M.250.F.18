The government, which has received praise from backers of the Lawrence family for its pursuit of the case, came in for criticism on Monday for actions it took this weekend to prevent publication of a leaked version of the report, which is due to be made public on Wednesday.
Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government inquiry, defined institutional racism as ``the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin'' reflected, he said, in ``processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.'' Richard Norton-Taylor, whose play about Lawrence's killing, ``The Color of Justice,'' has been playing to rave reviews in London, said that the attention paid to the Lawrence case and others was a sign that British attitudes toward the overarching authority of the police and other institutions were finally being called into question.
She said British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately.
A senior Scotland Yard police officer Wednesday apologized to the parents of a black teenager slain five years ago in a race killing that has become the focus of debate over relations between police and ethnic minorities.
