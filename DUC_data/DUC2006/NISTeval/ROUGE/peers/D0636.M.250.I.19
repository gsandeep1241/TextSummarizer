DETROIT ( AP ) General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers appear to have patched up their relationship with a lucrative four-year contract but at steep price for GM, industry experts said.
In a speech kicking off the union's triennial bargaining convention, Yokich said job security would again be the UAW's priority when it begins contract talks in June with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG.
The UAW has not held a national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut down most of the company's North American production.

The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $ 1,350
