Staver, however, said he believed the changes approved remove evolution as a unifying concept tying the sciences together.
Also, he said, they open the door for the teaching of creation science and the theory of intelligent design, which essentially says a higher power created the universe.
Some proponents of divine creation have organized a concept, called creationism, that they proposed be taught along with evolution.
In 1987, the Supreme Court barred states from requiring the teaching of creationism.
Now some of the same proponents support other concepts, such as ''abrupt appearance'' or ''intelligent design,'' that are linked to divine creation.

A conservative board member is expected to introduce a competing proposal that questions the validity of evolutionary theory.
It also describes creation as being the result of ``intelligent design.'' But to Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of Wildlife and Parks who presented the book to the Pratt board, ``Of Pandas and People'' and its theory of intelligent design provides the perfect antidote to those teachers who might be tempted to teach evolution as an undisputed fact.
Courts repeatedly have struck down efforts to teach such theories in science classes.
