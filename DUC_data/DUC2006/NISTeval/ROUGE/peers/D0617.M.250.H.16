But they do not single out a particular cause of the crash and do not include any analysis.
That speculation was fueled because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed in flight.
The Lauda Air crash killed all 223 people on board.
``There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
In November, with no evidence the crash was an accident, Hall was prepared to turn the investigation over to the FBI _ further fueling the theory of pilot suicide _ when the Egyptian government strenuously objected.
The U.S. Coast Guard said there were no reports of survivors from the crash.
Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew fight or pilot suicide.
If there is evidence of a crime in the plane crash, the investigation authority will be shifted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under U.S. rules.
Investigators doubt that the plane crash, which resulted in the death of all 217 aboard, may have been caused by a criminal act.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing all 217 people on board.
