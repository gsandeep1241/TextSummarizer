(Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) Support services for people with autism _ children and adults alike _ fall far short of fulfilling their needs today, says a new study.
And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside their family homes, the researchers say.
People with autism, a disorder that affects brain development, tend to have trouble communicating and relating to the outside world.
More than a half-million Americans have autism or some form of pervasive developmental disorder, says the Autism Society of America.
More cases of autism are being diagnosed than ever before, in part because of changes in diagnostic criteria, says study co-author Marsha Seltzer, a professor of social work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
``The service system is experiencing a crunch.
In some states, families have to have to wait several years or longer to get the services they need,'' Seltzer says.
Although many people think of autism as a childhood disease, she says it's really a lifelong struggle.
``Parents just shoulder a tremendous responsibility,'' Seltzer says.
``Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right around the time of diagnosis,'' she says.
After that, she says, ``It almost falls off the face of the research charts, but it never leaves the sphere of the family''.
Many families surveyed by Seltzer and her colleagues think their autistic children lack essential services.
