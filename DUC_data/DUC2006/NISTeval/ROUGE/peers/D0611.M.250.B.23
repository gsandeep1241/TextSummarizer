Spiders kill off insects and help plants boost seed production in exchange for dollops of sugary nectar.
Workers advance upon windowless structures on wheels, releasing thousands of clucking chickens eager for a good day's work at what they do best: eating bugs.
Solarization keeps diseases and blemishes at bay on a Vero Beach organic vegetable farm.
A layer of organic mulch beneath the canopy is a good idea as it helps preserve soil moisture and keeps soil temperature down.
Decaying plant wastes, such as grass clippings, leaves and vegetable scraps from the kitchen are great building blocks for compost, the ideal organic matter for your garden soil.

While other farmers were writing checks for annual applications of herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers, the Porters have faced higher upfront costs on soil preparation, including equipment, organic substances and labor.
The Porters produce organic grains sold to organic dairy farmers as feed, and raise food-grade organic soy beans to ship around the world for tofu production.
These local farmers are part of a growing national trend of organic farming, joining more than 6,000 other growers of everything from fruits and vegetables to animal feeds and food-grade soy beans.
