NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo and entered into Jupiter's atmosphere, was the first man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet.
Spacecraft Galileo will close in on Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede to gather the most detailed information ever obtained about the icy satellite, according to a NASA report.
The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by robotic space probes, scientists said at an all-day seminar on the latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter.
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
