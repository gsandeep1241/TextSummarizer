Cruising beyond Jupiter and Saturn, the spacecraft survived the creakiness of old age to swing by the other two outer giants, Uranus and Neptune, in the 1980s.
In the same tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft has defied engineering's actuarial tables to complete more than four years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four major moons, each one a spectacle to the eye and a surprise to the scientific mind.
Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
A team of researchers investigating the powerful magnetic field that pulsates around giant Jupiter reported Wednesday that a sophisticated instrument aboard their spacecraft has detected effects on the two Jovian moons that can best be explained by the existence of salty water conducting electricity beneath the mysterious satellites.
As for Jupiter's moon Europa, images of icebergs on the icy crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft after it reached the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow and brown matter that many scientists argue must indicate the presence of organic matter_the possible precursors of life_in a warm ocean miles beneath the ice.
