The Delphi- UAW talks will coincide with the union's triennial contract negotiations with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG. The UAW is expected to demand that Delphi 's hourly workers get virtually the same deal as GM 's hourly workers.
In 1996, the UAW negotiated first with Ford and used that deal as a pattern for pacts with Chrysler and GM . Wade McCaleb, secretary-treasurer of Local 1895, said workers at Visteon plants would remain Ford employees, while any new employees at Visteon will be covered by an agreement between the new company and the UAW that mirrors the one the union has with Ford . The UAW fears a separate parts company would try to cut jobs and lower wages.
National labor talks between Detroit 's automakers and the United Auto Workers began today against a background of record sales that have left General Motors CCorp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash.
Lower -level talks with Ford have gone on while the UAW worked on contracts with GM and DaimlerChrysler.
UAW hit Delphi with two strikes last summer that shut down GM 's North American assembly plants and cost Delphi $450 million.
The UAW currently forces GM to pay the same wages of at least $19 an hour to assembly plant workers and parts factory workers alike, even though nonunion parts makers pay only half as much to their workers.
The UAW also wanted Delphi workers covered
