JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Computer anti-virus experts in Jerusalem Sunday expressed their suspicion that a new, but even dangerous type of "I Love You" virus may have originated in Israel.
Network Associates, an Israeli hi-tech start-up company, reportedly was hit by the virus on Thursday, which is earlier than any other reports of such virus throughout the world, according to a company spokesman.
Thus, the company had begun its internal investigation to check whether an employee of the company had written the virus code and distributing it, currently known as "NewLove Bug".
The previous "Love Bug" rapidly spread throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States earlier this month, affecting thousands of computers and causing disastrous damages.
The "NewLove Bug", a modified type of "Love Bug", is using the same mechanism to spread itself by sending e-mails to persons in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express software's address book.
At first look, the only difference appeared that the new bug randomly chose its attachment filename but always has a.vbs extension.
In a more sophisticated examination, however, it is found that the new offshoot of the virus is much more dangerous as it will attaches itself to every file on the victims' computer drivers, while the previous bug reportedly written by a Filipino only attacked selected multimedia files.
The destructive move could be accomplished between 20 seconds to one minute, wiping out all files and only leaving a user with a blank hard disc once attempting to reboot .
