Evan's success is the kind of story that parents of young children with autism dream of and pray for, give up their jobs and sometimes their life savings to achieve.
Only about half of children with autism respond to treatment as well as Evan did.
The problem: Researchers can't tell in advance which 50 percent will respond.
For families, treatment is the most pressing concern.
``One of our concerns is the research seems to point to certain minimum number of hours (of treatment to be successful,)'' said Nellie Allnutt, social services coordinator of the Developmental Disabilities Division, King County.
``We're very concerned we won't be able to meet what's defined as best practice for these kids.'' Whatever the cause, the overall rise in the incidence of autism nationally has been dramatic.
Some states are reporting what appear to be significant increases in cases of autism, Dr. Bristol-Power said.
But it is not yet clear if the reports reflect higher incidence of the condition or better diagnosis and the availability of better treatment.
A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society of America, ``2000 National Conference on Autism: Celebrating Our Future,'' is focusing on treatment options, research and the incidence of autism.
The conference continues through Wednesday.
``Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right around the time of diagnosis,'' she says.
After that, she says, ``It almost falls off the face of the research charts, but it never leaves the sphere of the family.''
