The aging and glitch-prone Galileo spacecraft successfully flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, overcoming huge doses of radiation and a computer problem just hours before the approach.
Galileo, which was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995, has in recent months experienced problems with its stabilizing gyros and computers as years of radiation from the solar system's largest planet have taken their toll.
For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
The spacecraft was stable and information it sent suggested that observations of Europa were successfully stored in its tape recorder.
New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
Initial analysis of early data from Galileo probe has encouraged scientists to review their theories of planetary evolution, according to scientists at a NASA press conference Monday.
Within five years, NASA hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
