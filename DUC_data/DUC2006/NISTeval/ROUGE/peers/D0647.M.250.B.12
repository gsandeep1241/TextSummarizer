Court Rules against Cuban Boy's Relatives in US.
The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy return to Cuba.
The relatives of Elian Gonzalez the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to Elian father on Wednesday at a meeting here government officials said on Tuesday night.
Demonstrators sang and prayed outside the home where Elian Gonzales is staying as all sides in the custody battle waited for a federal appeals court ruling that could lead to the boy reunion with Cox father.
As Gonzalez was speaking Elian relatives in Miami appeared in a county Family Court with Elian great-uncle Lazaro Gonzales asking for temporary custody of the boy.
The US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) ruled that Elian belongs to Elian father in Cuba but Elian Miami relatives insist the boy stay with them in the United States.
Pressure mounts on the relatives of Elian Gonzales to turn the boy over to CoxNet father as Attorney General Janet Reno reportedly has given approval to take the child by force if necessary.
The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to Elian native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with Elian father and other relatives ending a seven- month long bitter custody battle.
The Miami relatives have mounted a legal campaign to keep Elian in the United States as supporters in Congress and many in Miami
