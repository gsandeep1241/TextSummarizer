If the spiders can pass the winter safely, the pests will not be a threat to the crops, says a local farmer.
For organic growers and most backyard gardeners, though, they are tough to control.
Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.
A weakness of a lot of farmers is marketing, said Brian Cramer, the gardener and orchard production manager at Sunnyside.
The lake area is the first in China to study pest control with spiders.
A comparison was not possible on the fourth farm, operated by Vero Beach organic grower KevinO'Dare, becauseO'Dare does not use methyl bromide or any other chemicals.
The North Coast is the hot spot for biodynamic farming in California, said Chuck Beedy, executive director of the San Francisco-based Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association.
At present, biological preparation has been used for the prevention and cure of more than 30 kinds of vegetable and plant pests and diseases.
These efforts are more environmentally friendly, but, he said, they also take a large volunteer force..
So came the idea for the grub-scouting party.
One advantage ( for the beetles ) of numbers like these is the chance at resistant mutations.
No matter which controls you use, a few will be resistant, and those few will be multitudes ere long.
If native shrubs are supposed to be more pest resistant, why are they being attacked? Wealthy
