To Generation Xers, that's just the way things are.
Slackers and Generation X types, it seems, are hardly slack when it comes to saving for retirement.
With far less job security than their parents had, they view career choice as something malleable, less defining.
Beck, who grew up as a latchkey kid, said she works full time out of economic necessity but would rather be home with her 2-month-old baby.
``To me, Generation X defines an age group; to others, it defines a work ethic and many other things as well,'' she says.
Zaira Balmaceda, 16, a Phoenix-area high school student, provides a positive outlook for Generation Y, or the millennials, Generation X's younger counterpart.
"I don't necessarily believe that traditional small cars with more progressive styling are what young buyers are after".
``The Xers knew the only reason they were in this world was because that yuppie parent had money and they were another possession,'' said Pace.
``They may be more sophisticated and more knowlegeable about one thing -- technology -- and because of that they won't give you credit for the things you've lived through,'' Rafoth said.
''Most people of Generation X are searching for a way back to religious faith, but the forms and the metaphors some traditions use in their denominations just don't resonate with them,'' Hammerman said.
``(I came) to pray with my fellow students because they took away our right to pray at the football games,'' Tannreuther said.
