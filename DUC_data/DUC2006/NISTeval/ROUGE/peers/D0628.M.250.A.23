After 14 months of treatment, 12 to 15 percent of kids on medication or combined therapy were diagnosed with ADHD, and 32 to 35 percent of children on psychosocial or community-based treatment still had the disorder.
But authors of the study - which involved 212 boys, including 75 with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD - said the findings should help allay concerns that giving children potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful habits later.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a one-a-day pill for attention-deficit disorder that is easier to take and possibly more effective than current three-a-day versions of the commonly prescribed drug Ritalin.
By comparison, her research found that 8 percent to 10 percent of children in second through fifth grades routinely took ADHD medication in school during the 1995-96 school year.
Behavior in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder improves dramatically when they take the controversial drug Ritalin.
Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the most common treatment for ADHD, which affects up to 2.5 million school-age children in the United States.
Medical experts and the drug's manufacturer say that despite the slaying, Adderall remains a safe and effective drug for controlling attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
Novartis Pharmaceutical Corp. and the American Psychiatric Association promoted the belief that a large number of children need to take Ritalin for attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the lawsuits filed in New Jersey and California allege.
