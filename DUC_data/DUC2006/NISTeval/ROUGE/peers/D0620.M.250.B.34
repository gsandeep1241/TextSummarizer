That was a question many principals and superintendents asked last year after a spate of school shootings across the country.
So they increased security, bought metal detectors and surveillance cameras, created profiles of potentially violent students.
``That's one of the great mysteries -- how do you identify a student who is going to act out''? said Barbara Wheeler, school board member in Downers Grove, Ill., and former president of the National School Boards Association.
Schools have also gotten more federal money in the past few years.
Six months ago President Clinton held a White House conference on school violence with about 800 educators and law-enforcement officials.
WASHINGTON _ Despite high-profile shootings at schools around the country in the past year, such violence has remained steady since 1992 and the world inside the classroom remains a relatively safe place, a report being released Wednesday concludes.
The Justice Policy Institute (JPI), a liberal criminal justice think tank with offices in Washington and San Francisco, said a media-driven public fear about school violence is ``overblown''.
The institute's report charged that policymakers in Washington and in state legislatures have overreacted to a crisis that does not exist and are engaged in a ``tragic misdirection of attention and resources''.
JPI's Jason Ziedenberg, co-author of the study, said, ``Juvenile violence is a real problem in society, but if you really want to track it down, you're looking wrong place.
There were 40 shooting deaths in schools in the 1997-1998 school year, the report said.
