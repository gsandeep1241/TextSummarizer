PALO ALTO, Calif.
_ Education reformers of conservative or libertarian stripe are already hanging crepe for the school voucher initiative on the California ballot next month.
It will be a major blow to their movement nationally if voters in the most populous state reject, for the second time in less than 10 years, the idea of giving public money to parents to help students escape public schools.
Vouchers are an intellectually interesting but largely untested article of faith for many in the camp that correctly diagnoses the poor state of public education but then often fixates on teachers unions, vehement opponents of vouchers, as the taproot of a problem that has far more diverse causes.
The California initiative, Proposition 38, would give parents $4,000 for every school-age child that could be spent for any form of currently sanctioned education _ including parochial, secular private, charter school, home schooling.
It's the brainchild of high-tech venture capitalist Tim Draper, a guy with more money than political skill.
Draper unwisely rejected pleas of some voucher supporters to target the proposal for the poor or on demonstrably wretched schools (which are virtually one and the same thing).
He also did not seek to insulate the measure from criticism that helped doom a similar California initiative in 1993, especially a lack of rules to guarantee equity and access in private education.
Draper has pledged to spend up to $20 million on the campaign.
