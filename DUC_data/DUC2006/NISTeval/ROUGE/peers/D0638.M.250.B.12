New evidence from NASA Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter moon Europa scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe latest flyby.
NASA aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet intense radiation.
Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by robotic space probes scientists said at an all-day seminar on the latest information from Galileo which is now orbiting Jupiter.
Galileo in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year.
Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto surface ice and even more likely in the depths of Europa.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
As for Jupiter moon Europa images of icebergs on the icy crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft after it reached the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow and brown matter that many scientists argue must indicate the presence of organic matter _ the possible precursors of life _ in a warm ocean
