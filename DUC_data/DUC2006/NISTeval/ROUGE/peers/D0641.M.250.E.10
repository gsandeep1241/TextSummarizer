``Global warming won't be a simple warming of the Earth.
In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.
Environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
However too many other complex effects influence the Earth's spin, such as movement of molten rock beneath its surface.
With the National Research Council panel's conclusion that the surface warming is real, ``one of the key arguments of the contrarians has evaporated,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist with Environmental Defense, formerly the Environmental Defense Fund.
They said that the changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of global warming.
Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
One whose views have evolved is Wallace but fairly open to arguments on both sides of the debate.
The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
After that, he said, it is impossible to predict the shape of the world's energy system and, therefore, greenhouse gas emissions.
