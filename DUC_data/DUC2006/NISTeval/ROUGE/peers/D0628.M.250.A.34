CHICAGO (AP) -- Hyperactive boys treated with drugs such as Ritalin were much less likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs as teen-agers than similar boys who had not been treated, researchers say.
Some experts not involved in the study said it was flawed and too small to reach meaningful conclusions.
But authors of the study -- which involved 212 boys, including 75 with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD -- said the findings should help allay concerns that giving children potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful habits later.
An estimated 3 million school-age children have ADHD, and as many as half may be taking Ritalin or other stimulants, past research indicates.
The subjects for the research were part of a previous study of families with an ADHD child and families with no ADHD children.
NORFOLK, Va.
(AP) -- Doctors may be overdiagnosing some groups of children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and overprescribing drugs to treat the condition, according to a new study published Wednesday.
Researchers examined about 30,000 grade-school children in two districts in southeastern Virginia and found that pupils took drugs for ADHD in school at two to three times the expected rate, according to the study in the American Journal of Public Health.
About 90 percent of patients take Ritalin, a mild central nervous system stimulant believed to calm hyperactivity by helping the brain disregard distracting stimuli.
ADHD has been estimated to affect 3 percent to 5 percent of school-age children nationwide, with less than
