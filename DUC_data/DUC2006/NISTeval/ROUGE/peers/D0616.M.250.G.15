He confirmed that the federal forces had possessed information that rebels were preparing more terrorist attacks.
It said 60 rebels, among them people speaking Russian, have formed a unit to carry out terrorist acts in Russia.
They have been linked to terrorist bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities this month.
He said the militants were planning ''a number of terrorist acts on the territory of Chechnya'' at the end of the month, but for the moment were concentrating on ''quick attacks'' on Russian checkpoints.''''...
The Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population were living.
`We have no border with Chechnya _ that is the Russian Federation and troop movements can take place there whenever necessary,'' Putin said.
78,000 refugees have fled to Ingushetia, a tiny and impoverished Russian region west of Chechnya.
Only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks.
Russia responded to the attacks by sending troops into Chechnya two weeks ago.
Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway republic's border with Dagestan.
The Russian military is trying to prevent incursions of Islamic militants from Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan.
