The findings bring to three the number of similar drugs that have worked well in large trials among compulsive children at multiple medical centers, said Dr. Judith L. Rapoport of the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institutes of Health.
The other OCD drugs approved for both age groups are clomipramine, marketed as Anafranil, and fluvoxamine, marketed as Luvox.
The newest medication shown safe and effective in compulsive youngsters is sertraline, marketed as Zoloft, according to the study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
In addition, the antidepressant fluoxetine, marketed as Prozac, has been reported in small trials to work well in childhood OCD, Rapoport said.
``For over a decade there have been observations among teachers and pediatricians of increasing behavioral disturbances in children,'' says Dr. Barry Zuckerman, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine.
Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says Rushton, is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, which have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants.
According to Rushton, heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the 1990s, which provided evidence that identifiable, biologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old.
