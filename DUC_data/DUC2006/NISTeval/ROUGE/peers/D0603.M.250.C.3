Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system.
However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands created by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows half of them fail.
A deputy commissioner of the city Department of Environmental Protection recommended that the strictest procedures be applied to proposals for developing the 2,000 square miles that drain into the reservoirs, with individual applications required for any filling or construction affecting more than one-third of an acre of wetlands.
DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act.
Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
Since last summer, the corps has been updating its nationwide system for issuing permits to fill wetlands, seeking to identify areas where wetlands are particularly vulnerable or important and need protection.
In two years, acres of wetlands 150 miles of streams had been destroyed because of what they as a loophole opened by a court decision three years ago The EPA has no say in the final decision on wetlands rules by the corps, but has indicated that the wetlands around the reservoirs deserve special protection.
Seven states, it said, have lost more than 80 percent of their original wetlands.
