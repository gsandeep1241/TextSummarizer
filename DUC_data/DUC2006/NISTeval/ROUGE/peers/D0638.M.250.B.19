( AP ) NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, Europa is wrenched by the tidal forces of Jupiter's overpowering gravity, Schubert said.
I think these findings tell us that there is indeed a layer of liquid water beneath Europa's surface, said Margaret Kivelson, a spacecraft scientist.
Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
In addition to the gravitational studies, Galileo has measured magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter and its moons.
This light show has been going on for a billion years, said Geissler, and this is the first time it has ever been seen..
Galileo, orbiting Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue taking photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year.
As it orbits Jupiter, Io intersects powerful magnetic field lines from the giant planet and acts like an enormous electrical generator.
