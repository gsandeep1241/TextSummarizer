`There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
Hall said Wednesday the flight data recorder indicates the plane did not reach such speeds.
The safety board is expected to release more information from the flight data recorder over the coming days.
It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
The flight data show the plane's elevators were uneven during the rapid descent.
Information from the plane's flight data recorder, one of the two black boxes, should tell investigators if a thruster deployed in flight.
The safety board is still investigating the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 in these same waters.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on October 31, 1999.
Hall said the government of Egypt has asked the U.S. government to take the lead in the crash investigation.
