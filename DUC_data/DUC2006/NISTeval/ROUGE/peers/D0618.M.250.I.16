According to Lateef Salako, Director-General of the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, "of the approximately 300 million cases of malaria estimated to occur globally every year, over 85 percent are from Africa, and of the estimated two to three million annual deaths, over 90 percent are in Africa." The experts said they were encouraged to come up with the strategy which channeled 10 million U.S. Dollars towards malaria control in Africa last year.
It was also envisaged that by the year 2030, malaria would no longer be the major cause of deaths in Africa.
The majority who die are African children and deaths linked to malaria in Africa overall are increasing, WHO said.
It stated that the costs for the treatment of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa exceeded 2.1 billion U.S. Dollars last year alone.
It is estimated that 300 to 500 million clinical cases and 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths occur due to malaria each year, about twice as many as 20 years ago, according to papers presented at the third Pan-African Conference on Malaria which ended here Wednesday.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have discovered a possible new way to vaccinate against malaria, which kills up to 3 million people a year and sickens an additional 300 million.
More than 6,000 people are estimated to have died from malaria this year, with most of the deaths occurring between January and May.
However, scientists estimate that it will take seven to 15 years before an effective malaria vaccine is ready.
