El Nino, which involves the equatorial waters in the Pacific warming up, creating unusual weather patterns around the world, increased winter temperatures by about 4 degrees centigrade.
Israeli scientists have achieved progress in predicting the chaotic behavior of El Nino, a warming of surface water of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, through a sophisticated computer simulation.
What the scientists know is that El Nino disrupts normal weather patterns : Trade winds may reverse direction, sending the warm water that normally moves toward Australia and Indonesia back toward the South American coast, with infamous consequences.
It turns out the periodic weather event produced a lot more good than bad.
