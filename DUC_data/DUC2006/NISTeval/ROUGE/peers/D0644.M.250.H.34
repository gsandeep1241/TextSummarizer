WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Rubin spent much of his life speculating what the stock market would do.
When he came to Washington, Rubin did essentially the same thing, speculating that if President Clinton would balance the budget, he would be rewarded with a booming economy.
And in the six years since, first as a top economic adviser and since 1995 as the Treasury secretary, Rubin has gained much credit -- in a close partnership with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- for the policies of spending restraint that kept interest rates low, Wall Street booming and many Americans raking in money.
``He generally did his best to keep the more liberal elements of the Clinton-Gore administration in check,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
Or, as Clinton put it as he announced Rubin's departure Wednesday, ``Everybody always believed that as long as he was secretary of the Treasury, nothing bad could happen''.
In addition, Rubin has spent much of the past year grooming his deputy, former Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, sending him to Capitol Hill and around the world when Asia's economy crashed.
Whether it's Republicans pushing for a big tax cut or Democrats trying to cover the cost of prescription drugs through Medicare, politicians here are drooling over a projected multitrillion-dollar budget surplus and vying over ways to spend it.
It is no casual question, for if recent experience is a guide, the 10- and 15-year budget projections on which elected officials are relying could be elusive and ephemeral.
