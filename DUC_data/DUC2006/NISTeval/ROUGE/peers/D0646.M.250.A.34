WASHINGTON _ Even President Clinton concedes that he did not tell the truth about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
But did he commit perjury under the definition of the law?
``That is where the evidence is most compelling,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.
, a member of the House Judiciary Committee.
Many Democrats say that even if the president did lie under oath about a sexual relationship, it is insufficient grounds for impeachment.
But the president also said his answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones case last January, when he denied having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, were ``legally accurate''.
Some potential swing-vote Republicans say that if President Clinton would admit he committed perjury when he said he had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, they would vote against impeachment.
If Clinton makes such a statement, they fear, then other Republicans might seize on it as a rationale for impeachment, and a prosecutor might use it to indict Clinton after he leaves office.
All of this raises two key questions: Did Clinton commit perjury?
The answers may well determine the president's fate.
Ruff said that while Clinton may have walked ``up to the line'' of lying, he was being truthful ``in his mind'' and ``that is the heart and soul of perjury''.
Kenneth Starr may have convinced most of America that President Clinton lied under oath, but he would have a difficult time proving in a court of law that the president is guilty of perjury.
