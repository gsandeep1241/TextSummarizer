  <line></line>
  <line>Indians comprise less than 1% of the population but tribes differ widely.</line>
  <line>Tribal burocracies are scattered and ineffective.</line>
  <line>Many reservations are remote with little access to development.</line>
  <line>Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment.</line>
  <line>Poor communications facilities impact the low literacy rate.</line>
  <line>Long rides to school means students can't stay to use school resources.</line>
  <line>There is poor health care and higher than average death rates from alcohol, diabetes, suicide, and accidents.</line>
  <line>The nature of the land -- &quot;held in trust&quot; -- effectively shuts the Indians out of conventional home loan processes.</line>
  <line>Federal aid programs are inadequate and impacted by outdated maps and census figures.</line>
  <line>Privileges of tribal sovereignty include unique hunting and fishing rights, and the ability to sell gas and cigarettes tax-free, set zooming, and ban or sell alcohol.</line>
  <line>Reservations can set up casinos, bringing jobs and money.</line>
  <line>However, only a few casinos are profitable.</line>
  <line>Furthermore, there is concern that the casinos bring many non-Indians as customers and managers, and erode historic values and traditions.</line>
  <line>Tribal sovereignty leads to a number of other issues.</line>
  <line>Some reservations impose taxes on non-native Americans who work or live on their land and who do not have any voice in the local government.</line>
  <line>Indian cigarette factories, not having to pay tax, can undersell non-reservation factories.</line>
  <line>Fishing and hunting privileges cause concern among conservationists that regions will be depleted.</line>
  <line>Many feel different rights based on bloodline is unconstitutional.</line>
  <line></line>

  <line>D0601.M.250.A.B</line>
  <line>---------------</line>
  <line></line>
  <line>Indian tribes on reservations enjoy a unique legal status.</line>
  <line>Their sovereignty allows them to run casinos and enjoy extraordinary fishing and hunting rights.</line>
  <line>Indians working on reservations pay federal income and social security taxes, but not state income, gasoline, or cigarette taxes.</line>
  <line>They can vote in local, state, and federal elections.</line>
  <line>Casinos have brought a new level of prosperity and opportunity to many tribes.</line>
  <line>But some are troubled by legal battles with states that either outlaw gambling or want to tax the profits.</line>
  <line>At least half the Indian population lives in poverty.</line>
  <line>Unemployment often exceeds 50%, 29% are homeless, and 59% live in substandard housing, many lacking plumbing and telephones.</line>
  <line>Students on reservations have the lowest test scores, the highest truancy and dropout rates, and the lowest rate of entering college.</line>
  <line>Schools are in disrepair, lack computers and internet access, and have few qualified teachers.</line>
  <line>Health care is the worst in the country.</line>
  <line>The death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the population.</line>
  <line>Indians are over twice as often victims of violent crimes, 60% of which are perpetrated by whites.</line>
  <line>Confusion arises over jurisdiction for crimes committed on reservations.</line>
  <line>Minor crimes by Indians come under tribal authority.</line>
  <line>The FBI or Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for serious crimes.</line>
  <line>Crimes by non-Indians come under local authority.</line>
  <line>Indians are arrested over twice as often than any other racial group for alcohol-related offenses.</line>
  <line>Many children are affected by their parents' alcohol abuse through neglect and exposure in the womb.</line>
  <line></line>
  <line></line>
  <line>---------------</line>
  <line>D0601.M.250.A.C</line>
  <line>---------------</line>
  <line></line>
  <line>Half of Native American Indians on reservations live in poverty with poor health care, substandard housing, and limited computer access.</line>
  <line>Drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education, teen births, and lack of jobs creates unemployment 10 times the national average.</line>
  <line>Violent crime is increasing, especially on poor reservations.</line>
  <line>Continuing prejudice against Indians results in drunken attacks by whites.</line>
  <line>Police are insufficient and ill-equipped.</line>
  <line>Some tribes generate significant income from businesses and manufacturing.</line>
  <line>One-third of tribes offer gambling.</line>
  <line>Casinos aren't always successful and are often opposed by localities that don't want local gambling or competitors who fear untaxed competition.</line>
  <line>Many Indians leave the reservation.</line>
  <line>Others worry that tribal values and customs are deteriorating.</line>
  <line>Reservations grant tribes self-rule and reserve sovereign land for them.</line>
  <line>The federal government pays for reservation clinics, schools, and welfare.</line>
  <line>Indians on reservations with 50% unemployment are exempt from welfare caps.</line>
  <line>State taxes are not levied on Indians' reservation income.</line>
  <line>Tribes can tax non-Indian reservation employees.</line>
  <line>They can determine local zoning, fishing and hunting rules; ban alcohol; and open casinos.</line>
  <line>Tribal authorities deal with minor crimes but turn to federal help for more serious crime.</line>
  <line>Problems facing Indians and the reservation system include decreased funding for Indian programs; repeal of affirmative action laws; Indian culture and local regulations conflicting with federal or state laws, tribes not being fully recognized and having no access to federal funds; and banks unwilling to give Indians home loans that are backed by land held in trust.</line>
  <line></line>
  <line></line>
  <line>---------------</line>
  <line>D0601.M.250.A.E</line>
  <line>---------------</line>
  <line></line>
  <line>Life on most Indian reservations is marked by extreme poverty, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, failed education, rising crime rates and high unemployment.</line>
  <line>At least half of U.S. Indians live in poverty.</line>
  <line>Forty-nine percent of those living on reservations are unemployed.</line>
  <line>Of the 1.43 million living on or near reservations, 29% are homeless and 59% live in substandard housing.</line>
  <line>The Indian death rate is 35 times that of the rest of the population with high incidence of alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicides.</line>
  <line>On the positive side the reservation system has helped preserve Indian culture, to recognize Indian sovereignty and to provide federal funds for roads, schools, clinics and a welfare system.</line>
  <line>The system also recognizes Indian fishing and hunting rights and frees residents from state taxes, while providing the right to vote in local, state, and federal elections.</line>
  <line>The 1988 Indian Gaming Act allowed reservations to operate bingo gaming and, subject to compacts with states, slot machine gaming.</line>
  <line>Several reservations near population centers have successfully established casinos that provide income to alleviate extreme poverty.</line>
  <line>More employees of casinos are not Indians so the unemployment problem is not solved.</line>
  <line>Casinos on remote reservations have not been successful and some tribes reject casinos.</line>
  <line>Federal funding is inadequate to satisfy the staggering needs of reservations.</line>
  <line>Some tribes have made claims against the federal government contesting past seizure of historic tribal lands, but this seems unlikely to solve the problems.</line>

 <text>
  <line>The Yakama Nation, which already bans liquor sales on tribal land, has imposed a new tax on alcohol sold on private land within the reservation and a $5,000 license fee on liquor distributors.</line>
  <line>Among the spending Clinton will seek: $300 million to build at least six new reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.</line>
  <line>For instance, on the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, about one in eight Navajos were not counted in 1990.</line>
  <line>They come into Elaine Newton's court by the dozens, charged with underage drinking, using marijuana, fighting.</line>
  <line>Tribal leaders figured that slot machines would provide new revenue for the tribe's 1,200 members, many of whom have lived in poverty for years.</line>
  <line>But they forgot that most of the 100,000 visitors to Grand Canyon West each year come directly from Las Vegas.</line>
  <line>Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996 federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.</line>
  <line>But as the 27-year-old McCarty runs barefoot along Hobuck Beach, he does not think about the global forces aligned against the 1,800 people living in his fishing village.</line>
  <line>By 10 o'clock on a typical summer's morning, Hancock County is almost deserted.</line>
