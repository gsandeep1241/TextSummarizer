AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Two Moroccan female athletes have been stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an official said Friday.
Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee.
A second Moroccan, Karima Shaheen, will also lose the bronze medal for the women's discus throw, Kazem said.
Both athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, a muscle-building steroid that has been the cause of a rash of recent positive tests -- including several at the Pan American Games and even others announced this week in advance of the World Championships.
Kazem said only Shaheen's and Hanifi's samples tested positive among the 84 sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in the German city of Kreischa, near Leipzig.
``Compared to international figures, this is reasonable,'' Kazem said.
``We only tested athletes competing in the track and field events.
No other tests have been conducted yet,'' he said.
He said most gold medal winners were tested.
Suspicions about Hanifi were raised after she boosted her performance dramatically in the 200 meters, a day after losing badly in the 100 meters.

(For use by New York Times News Service clients) By JENNIFER BABSON c.1998 The Boston Globe BOSTON _ In the midst of an economic and real estate boom, many low- and moderate-income residents are struggling to find and keep a place to live, according to a study being touted as the first comprehensive examination in more than a decade on the state of housing in Massachusetts.
The report by the University of Massachusetts' Donahue Institute, concludes that one out of every four households in Massachusetts _ renters and homeowners alike _ are contending with a ``severe housing affordability problem,'' with a number facing homelessness, eviction or foreclosure.
``This is the first statewide study on housing that has been done in more than decade,'' said Aaron Gornstein, executive director of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association,which sponsored the study.
The report's focus is on people like Theresa Shenett, who wonders whether she will soon be spending the holidays in a homeless shelter.
Shenett is now waiting for a judge to decide whether her landlord may evict her from a one-bedroom Jamaica Plain apartment she shares with her son and a relative.
``It's taken away all the spirit of Christmas,'' Shenett said during a recent interview, tears on her tired face.
A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in Massachusetts.
``They are mostly working people, they have jobs, but the jobs aren't paying enough for them to pay for the cost of housing,'' said Michael Stone, a professor at UMass Boston, and one of the authors of the study.
``Prosperity on the one hand tends to mask the plight of many, many people, not just poor people but middle-income people who aren't sharing in the prosperity.''
Finding affordable housing has also been made more difficult by the fact that a number of apartment owners have sold their properties as condos, taking advantage of the strong real estate market.

Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting the Middle East peace process, also revealed that there are still 5,892 new housing units now under construction in various settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement expansion.

California is to allocate 54 million dollars in 1998 for subsidies to solar energy users while Arizona requires that at least 1 percent of new energy generation comes from solar resources.
Yunnan Province, rich in solar energy, has set up a solar energy research center, the country's first station for inspecting the quality of solar water heaters and a key lab for rural energy resources projects.
The province has made marked progress in developing solar water heater, solar furnace, solar battery and basic theoretical research on the solar energy.
Professor Xia Laifeng from Yunnan Teachers' University, the solar energy research base in the province, said that they are studying the possibility of building "solar energy houses," which use solar energy for heating and air conditioning, and are decorated with solar energy equipment.
YAOUNDE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The two-day seminar on solar energy ended here this evening after discussing how to develop and apply solar energy in the rural areas in Africa.
According to a local source, solar energy equipment will soon be flown to Harare from Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, The equipment will be provided and operated by Zhejiang Provincial Energy Research Institute and Zhejiang Meida Solar Energy Industry Corporation Ltd. China provided solar systems to rural households in Zimbabwe to generate electricity in 1998.
Tibet has plenty of solar energy resources and Japan has a great deal of experience in the use of solar energy, according to a local official, who says that China and Japan will continue to cooperate in building power projects in Tibet.
KUNMING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Remote Yunnan Province in the southwestern part of China has become a leading solar energy producer, accounting for a quarter of the country's solar energy output.
The team demonstrated to members of the district local councils the solar equipment used in tapping solar electricity which included the bulbs, the panels which store solar energy, the solar-operated laterns and battery.
YAOUNDE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The seminar on solar energy and development opened in Yaounde today with emphasis on the advantages of solar energy in rural areas.

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State health officials Friday said a dead crow found in River Edge, Bergen County tested positive for the West Nile virus.
The bird was one of 120 crows so far tested by state officials.
Results were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
''The New Jersey test shows that the surveillance system we have established to monitor West Nile virus is working as planned,'' Christine Grant, state commissioner of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.
Blood samples taken from 43 test chickens stationed in every county have proved negative for the virus, according to Grant.
The virus has not been found in tests of mosquito pools in eight counties.
Last year, health workers found traces of the virus in 74 crows and two mosquito pools.
No New Jersey resident was found to carry the virus, state officials said.
Last year, West Nile - first misdiagnosed as St. Louis encephalitis - killed six people in New York City and one in Westchester and sickened more than 60.
It was also blamed for hundreds of bird deaths - mostly crows - in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and it killed several horses on Long Island.

(mk) By DOUGLAS MARTIN c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service NEW YORK _ Since the city banned smoking in restaurants in 1995, restaurateurs have complained that the prohibition is bad for business.
On Monday, a group of academic researchers, admittedly anti-smoking ones, released a series of six analyses suggesting that the ban has not hurt.
The studies indicated that the anti-smoking law, which took effect on April 10, 1995, has had no effect on local sales, job growth or income.
The studies, which were financed by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program, which receives money from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, showed that restaurant industry jobs rose 18 percent from 1993 to 1997, to 19,347.
During the same period, sales tax receipts rose 2 percent at restaurants in the city but dropped 4 percent in the rest of the state.
The number of restaurants in the city during that period increased 6 percent.
At a news conference, the researchers characterized their work as the first comprehensive look at the city's ban on smoking in restaurants with 35 or more seats.
They said earlier studies suggesting economic harm were smaller and were financed by the tobacco industry.
``Local officials can now go about their business of protecting the public from the toxins in second-hand smoke without worrying about this phony issue,'' said Dr. Stanton Glantz, who wrote an editorial accompanying the articles, which are published in the January issue of Public Health Management and Practice.
Mike O'Neal, who owns O'Neal's restaurant on West 64th Street, near Lincoln Center, supported the ban, saying it has helped his business.

NEW YORK (AP) -- A computer virus timed to strike Windows PCs on Christmas Day has yet to pose a significant threat because of its low prevalence, but anti-virus software makers are gearing up to help computer users combat it.
The new virus, named W32/Kriz.3862, is designed to damage Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT machines.
The virus overwrites data on hard drives and destroys the memory that stores a computer's setup, sometimes making a computer unbootable.
Only two cases of the virus have been detected ``in the wild'' so far, said Sal Viveros, group marketing manager in the virus defense division of Santa-Clara, Calif.-based Network Associates, maker of the McAfee virus protection software.
Network Associates ranks the virus as a ``medium risk'' because of its low prevalence.
Viveros said Network Associates would upgrade the assessment if more cases of the virus are reported.
The virus contains a profane, anti-religious message, Viveros said Thursday.
``That could be why it may hit on Christmas,'' he said.
Another maker of virus protection software, Central Command Inc., said the W32/Kriz virus is more destructive than the Chernobyl virus that recently attacked 300,000 computers in Asia and the Middle East.
That virus did not affect Windows NT machines, used by businesses, as the W32/Kriz virus does.

Harvey L. Cripps and Toshie T. Cripps said "it is grossly unfair to suggest China has a policy of letting children die in the orphanages based on one person's dated and uncorroborated report on one orphanage".
"The mass media or one organization does not represent the American people, either.
We feel the reports or TV's news make an unfair impression," they said.
John and Elaine Carrillo from Arizona, who are in the last stage of our adoption process, voiced their similar viewpoints.
Ken and Brenda Barker, who have adopted a child in 1992 from Changsha City in central China's Hunan Province, said "our experience was very different than that of the recent newspaper articles, and we visited the orphanage as well."
"Our daughter, Joy, is the greatest gift that we could have ever asked for.
Everyone who meets here absolutely adores her.
She is full of 'joy'," they said.
"We would love to adopt again, it was such a wonderful experience.
We also loved the people, culture, and land of China," they added.

PARIS (AP) -- French investigators met Thursday to try to determine what new safety measures are required before Air France can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
The panel of experts, including French aviation authorities and Air France representatives, was working to establish the chain of events that led to the disaster and make a recommendation to the Transportation Ministry.
The technical investigation into the crash is going quickly, Gilles Ricono, the top aide to Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, said after the meeting.
But he said experts still had to clarify a number of key issues before a ban on Air France Concorde flights is lifted.
The meeting came a day after French authorities established a special investigation unit to establish legal responsibility and potential liability for the July 25 crash in which 113 people were killed.
The unit includes 44 members of the French national police and three judicial experts.
Air France Flight 4590 smashed shortly after takeoff into a hotel in the town of Gonesse north of Paris.
It was the first crash ever of the sleek jet, once the pride of French aviation.
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights a day after the crash.
Air France Concorde flights were immediately suspended.

PEACH SPRINGS, Ariz. (AP) - When American Indians began embracing gambling as an economic development tool in the 1990s, the Hualapai tribe in northern Arizona moved quickly to open a casino at its Grand Canyon West tourist site.
Tribal leaders figured that slot machines would provide new revenue for the tribe's 1,200 members, many of whom have lived in poverty for years.
But they forgot that most of the 100,000 visitors to Grand Canyon West each year come directly from Las Vegas.
''Those people weren't coming to a casino,'' said Louise Benson, tribal chairman.
''They were coming to see the Grand Canyon.''
Less than a year after opening the casino, the Hualapai shut it down.
Instead of providing an economic boom to tribal members, it left them $1 million in debt.
''There were high hopes for that casino, but the reality of it was that we were too isolated,'' said Alex Cabillo, the tribe's director of public works.
The Hualapai tribe is one of only two whose casinos failed during the Indian gambling boom of the past decade, when revenues exploded from $100 million in 1988 to $8.26 billion in 1998.
But an Associated Press computer analysis of federal unemployment, poverty and public assistance records indicates that the vast majority of American Indians, like the Hualapai, have not realized the early ''high hopes'' of the casino boom.

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28: In a step recalling Maoist political re-education campaigns, Beijing has sent 1,200 officials belonging to the Falun Gong spiritual movement to special schools to study Communist literature and recant their allegiance to the group.
That is disturbing behavior from a Chinese leadership that proclaims its commitment to economic reform and modernization and that signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing Chinese citizens free expression, assembly and religion.
The Falun Gong says it has no political agenda, but it has a popular exiled leader, tens of millions of followers and a remarkable ability to organize protests under the noses of China's omnipresent police.
Beijing at first treated it cautiously, but has now banned the movement, confiscated its literature and detained thousands of members in a crackdown said to be ordered by President Jiang Zemin.
Special factors may explain the vehemence of Beijing's moves against the Falun Gong.
Rapidly growing religious cults are particularly frightening to Chinese governments because of their historical role in sparking unrest.
New religious groups have grown in recent years as the discrediting of Communist ideology and the suppression of democracy movements have left a spiritual void.
The Falun Gong's emergence also coincides with economic strains.
Growth rates are falling and unemployment rising.
New reforms advocated by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji like slimming state enterprises and liberalizing trade threaten further dislocation.

By RUTH TEICHROEB c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer SEATTLE _ The sheer magnitude of the slaughter at Littleton's Columbine High School has put Puget Sound-area schools on high alert and prompted sober reviews of school security, including a special meeting this week between Seattle police and school officials.
Local school districts are also reassessing whether lockdown drills _ which are not required by law _ should become mandatory, and are offering training to anxious teachers and principals who feel ill-prepared to respond to armed intruders.
``I hadn't dreamt it could be this horrific,'' said Brian Benzel, chief operations officer of the 48,600-student Seattle School District, referring to the Columbine killings in Littleton, Colo. ``It's just chilling...
It seems like we're going to have to expand our thinking about how to be prepared.''
Benzel and other district officials are meeting this week with Seattle police to review emergency strategies and discuss whether more could be done to prevent an attack like that carried out by the two heavily armed Columbine seniors, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
``It seemed very appropriate that we review procedures and protocol given what happened,'' Benzel said.
``We've had a pretty good relationship with SPD but we want to look at what could be improved.''
Harris and Klebold took the lives of 12 students and one teacher and injured 20 others on April 20 before turning their weapons on themselves.
Seattle police officers serve as school resource officers, visiting regularly and getting to know students and school buildings, said Larry Ferrar, the district's security director.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jupiter's moon Europa probably could not support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely support single-cell organisms, let alone complex species such as those found on Earth, researchers said Thursday.
Some scientists had suggested oceans exist beneath the frozen surface on Europa, boosting theories that life could develop on Jupiter's fourth-largest moon.
The ocean theory was suggested by data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft.
But a layer of ice at least 6 miles deep blocks the sun's life-sustaining energy from the water, according to a paper published in the journal Science.
``You're not going to find fish swimming in the Europan ocean,'' said Joseph Kirschvink, one of the authors and a professor of geobiology at the California Institute of Technology.
Organisms could live in the oceans heated by the strain of Jupiter's gravitational pull, researchers had said.
``We hate to throw cold water on it, but ... it's basically a smothered planet,'' Kirschvink said.
It's possible that Europan organisms could derive their energy from rust, which is oxidized iron, or through some other source.
``But we are talking about very simple organisms that can live on these energy sources,'' said Eric Gaidos, the paper's lead author and a geobiologist at Caltech.

(Repeating)  (The Week in Review) By PAM BELLUCK c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service It's not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.
In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science curriculum.
The word is expected to be restored after the November school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.
Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic.
Rather, they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their children's future and the future of their state.
These dot-com times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
``There is a realization that we can't have an informed generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell, a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.
``It's their right, it's their inheritance.
Instead of seeing science as an enemy, you see it as a tool.''
The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution proponents in Kansas.

WINE POTPOURRI: Fetzer Grows Grapes the Biodynamic Way By Gerald D. Boyd c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  In this time of eye-popping technology where kitchen appliances talk to you and the electronic map in your car chides you for being such a navigational nerd, it is almost refreshing to hear an unbelievably low-tech way of grape farming.
Almost, because the principles of biodynamics, a sort of ``beyond organics'' implies some far-out ideas and practices that modern folks have long since dismissed as archaic and backward.
Farming by the movement of the planets and the moon, burying a steer horn packed with manure in the vineyard and spraying vines with crystals, may sound like weird science but it swayed Jim Fetzer.
He's selling his 100 percent biodynamically-grown grapes to Fox Creek Winery for the first commercial biodynamic wines.
Fetzer, a member of the Mendocino Fetzer wine family, was once a traditional California wine-grape grower leaning toward organics.
He now owns Ceago Vinegarden vineyard in Mendocino County, a certified biodynamic vineyard.
Fetzer looked at the evidence of farming the biodynamic way and how the program replenishes the earth, and was impressed.
He found soils that had become sterile from too many chemicals could be brought back to health and produce high quality grapes.
``You can smell the difference in the soil,'' Fetzer says.

LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in leading British newspapers Wednesday.
The Times: -- England plunged out of the World Cup Tuesday night when they were beaten on penalties by Argentina, who is to go on to meet Holland in the quarter-finals.
Financial Times: -- Prime Minister Tony Blair has recognized that his ambition of carving a powerful role for the UK within the European Union (EU) could take 10 years and has commissioned a sweeping review of the UK's approach to the EU.
The Daily Telegraph: -- For the second time in a World Cup, England's dream of glory disintegrated in the agony of a penalty shoot-out Tuesday night.
The Independent: -- The five men suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence were thumped and pelted with bottles by an enraged crowd Tuesday after a day of evasive and implausible evidence that made a mockery of their appearance before the public inquiry.
The Guardian: -- The five men suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence could face perjury charges after their two days of evidence ended Tuesday with them fleeing from the inquiry building under a hail of missiles from an angry crowd.
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw announced on Wednesday the targets for the recruitment of black and Asian officers for every police force in England and Wales.
Straw said he hoped that in 10 years' time, every force in England and Wales would reflect the racial make-up of the area it served.
"There is a real determination within the police service by officers of every rank to put the past in terms of attitudes to race behind them," the home secretary said.
The report on police handling of the racist murder of the south London teenager Stephen Lawrence prompted the reform.

HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaria spread in 14 central and central highland provinces of Vietnam in the first seven months this year, Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
The number of malaria patients and deaths increased by 5.71 percent and 14.9 percent respectively in these provinces.
Seven of 14 provinces in the region saw rapid increases in the number of malaria patients, and 54 deaths were reported.
32 villages in seven communes of Tra My district of Quang Nam province had outbreaks of malaria, with 15,000 people infected.
The worsening epidemic is attributed to neglect of prevention measures against the deadly disease.
Unseasonably warm weather, which caused the rapid development of mosquito sectors, low standards of living, limited awareness of malaria and a weak health care network were other factors to blame.
To remedy the situation, local health care networks would be strengthened, disease prevention facilities better supplied and awareness on malaria prevention raised, reports said.
enditem nnnn WASHINGTON(AP) -- Americans won a new drug Friday to prevent malaria when they travel to countries ravaged by the mosquito-borne infection.
The Food and Drug Administration approved Malarone, the first new anti-malaria option in 11 years.
Malaria is a parasitic infection that is one of the world's worst scourges.

By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash. _ For roughly half of the millions of salmon born on the Snake River that set out each spring for the Pacific Ocean, the journey past four federal dams is an arduous and often lethal one.
They can be whacked to death by giant blades of the dam turbines, knocked out from collisions with concrete spillways, or succumb to a fatal condition not unlike the bends.
The other half of the salmon have a much simpler trip: They get to take the boat.
But this annual free ride, by which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers loads the young fish on barges and totes them around the dams, is coming under scrutiny like never before.
And for scientists, lawmakers, farmers, fishermen, American Indians, barge shippers, environmentalists and a breathtaking array of other interested parties, the assessment is most likely the key to a momentous decision that will ultimately fall to Congress: whether to take down the Snake River dams altogether.
The job of protecting the baby salmon, so they can mature and breed, is a remarkable feat of engineering and an expensive _ critics say outlandish _ accommodation to man's demands for electricity.
Thousands of fish a day are diverted to a channel leading to a pipe that runs into a trailer downstream of this dam, the first of the four, which is near the Idaho border.

By JOHN MARSHALL c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer ``You've Got Mail'' is an enticing first kiss of a film, with stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as irresistible as free puppies outside a store and New York City looking like a flower-bedecked nirvana, which is why audiences are falling hard for this season's most popular romantic comedy.
But there is one group of people who watch ``You've Got Mail'' and see something other than Hollywood romance.
Never mind the ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' romantics of Nora Ephron's film.
Independent booksellers focus more on the movie's subplot and feel as though they are watching their own funeral.
Because ``You've Got Mail'' is the first popular entertainment to focus on the plight of embattled independent booksellers as they try to survive the tidal wave of chain superstores (Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders) along with such online competitors as Seattle-based Amazon.com.
It is a tense battle that has involved not only a war of words, but also lawsuits as independent booksellers have taken their case to court, alleging that chain superstores have engaged in unfair trade practices and extracted favoritism from publishers.
The chains still march on.
In six years, independent booksellers have gone from selling one-third of the books in this country to half that percentage and many beloved independents have closed, including the recent demise of the Printers Inc. bookstore in Palo Alto, Calif.
So while other viewers feel a tug at their heartstrings as the Ryan and Hanks characters perform their wise-cracking mating ritual, booksellers brush away tears as the adorable little children's bookstore run by Ryan's character (Kathleen Kelly) is imperiled by a chain superstore run by Hanks' character (Joe Fox).

We can relieve the tingling and numbness, he said, keep your hands from falling asleep and restore some of the strength, but it's not going to get rid of all your pain.
I had arthritis.
That was five years ago, plenty of time to have recovered from successful carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists and to become much more aware of the lingering pain of arthritis.
Thumbs throbbing, fingers stiff, wrists aching, neck and shoulders burning like muscles pushed to the limits of exercise, arthritis can wake you up at night _ sometimes with tender spots that feel as if you must have been sleeping on pea gravel.
Others say arthritis feels like having shards of glass in your joints.
I take a lot of Tylenol and Aleve and have tried cortisone injections and capsaicin cream, the topical analgesic made from red pepper.
I've never hurt badly enough to deliberately submit to bee stings in the hope that the venom might relieve the pain, but some arthritis sufferers are willing to take that risk.
They spend more than $1 billion a year on unproven remedies for the pain and inflammation of more than 100 different types of arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
``We spend as much on unproven remedies for this disease as we do on research,'' says Dr. Bernard Rubin, chief of rheumatology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.

(mk) By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service WASHINGTON _ A top official in the Clinton administration strongly objected Wednesday to a Republican plan that would allow some money theoretically earmarked for Social Security to be spent for other purposes over the next two years.
At the same hearing before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, a senior Democratic congressman worried aloud that President Clinton would lure Democratic lawmakers into taking difficult stands on Social Security and then, as he has on occasion in the past, reverse course and leave his legislative allies stranded politically.
The administration official, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the president's chief spokesman on Social Security, said a plan announced on Tuesday by Republicans in the House would make it more difficult to keep the retirement system solvent.
Under that plan, Congress could dip into the interest payments the Treasury owes the Social Security reserves for the next two years and use the money for tax cuts or spending on programs like the military and education.
After two years, when the operating budget of the government is projected to start running a surplus, no further money collected in Social Security taxes would be used for other purposes.
Summers said he had ``very considerable concern'' that the plan would give Congress ``more room for dissipating the surplus.''
By the administration's calculations, the federal budget will have a surplus next year of $117 billion.
That will result from the government's collecting $129 billion more in Social Security taxes than it will spend in benefits and a deficit of $12 billion in the operating budget.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The government of President Hugo Chavez, who campaigned for office deriding what he called savage capitalism and neoliberal free-market policies, plans to privatize three electric utilities by year end.
&QL; &UR; AP Photo CAR110 &QL; &UR; By BART JONES &QC; &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A left-wing coalition led by a former coup leader has become the top force in Venezuela's new Congress, initial results showed Monday, in a major setback for the two political parties that have governed for 40 years since the restoration of democracy.
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service CARACAS, Venezuela _ With his landslide victory Sunday securing his place as the next president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez Frias might have been expected to smooth over the tracks of his first attempt to storm the presidential palace here, in 1992, in case other revolutionaries got the same idea.
At a time when the rest of Latin America has been moving largely toward streamlining the role of government and selling off state assets, Chavez speaks of subordinating the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, to domestic priorities, and asks whether $9 billion earmarked for operations and investment by the oil company should not go to shore up decaying schools and hospitals instead.

MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a top government official said Wednesday.
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is overseeing the salvage mission, told lawmakers that a contract would be initialed Saturday with a Norwegian company.
He did not name the company.
Klebanov said the retrieval work would begin before Oct. 10, and could be finished next month.
But he cautioned that the operation would be complex ''because sections one through five (of the submarine) are just heaps of metal,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
While Klebanov wouldn't name the company that will help Russia do the work, he said it was not Norway's Stolt Offshore.
A deal with Stolt had been expected, but reportedly fell through over the amount of the fee.
According to the newspaper Kommersant, Stolt Offshore wanted $12 million but Russia offered $9 million.
Russian divers don't have the equipment or the training to conduct the operation alone.
The Kursk was shattered by an explosion and sank in the Barents Sea during exercises Aug. 12.

(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) By JOHN MORITZ c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov.
George W. Bush, who has presided over more executions than any governor in modern American history, said on Friday that he favors DNA testing on condemned inmates to ``erase all doubts'' that an innocent person might be put to death.
Lawyers who defend Death Row inmates called Bush's remark ``encouraging,'' but questioned why the governor has not pushed for a law requiring DNA testing in the state that leads the nation in executions.
``Not only should they be doing DNA testing for Death Row inmates, but for all inmates where the science could prove guilt or innocence,'' said Barry Scheck, who gained national prominence as part of O.J.
Simpson's legal defense team.
``The technology is such where we now have this magic bullet of truth and we should be using it in every case where it would make a difference,'' Scheck said.
Scheck is working with Austin lawyer Maurie Levin on behalf of Texas Death Row inmate Ricky McGinn, whose execution is scheduled for June 1.
The lawyers filed a petition on Friday with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on McGinn's behalf that DNA testing be used in his case.
McGinn was convicted of raping and killing a 12-year-old girl in Brown County in Central Texas.
He has denied committing the crimes, and his lawyers say DNA testing on the hair and body fluid samples found at the crime scene are essential to settle any doubt in the case.

(fe) By MICHAEL JANOFSKY c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service RICHMOND, Va. _ Here on the streets of Virginia's capital, Melvin Douglas Smith was known for his luck as much as his troublemaking.
For all the charges brought against him in state courts over a decade, from larceny and resisting arrest to illegal firearms and murder, none stuck.
He never served a day in prison.
Then Smith's luck ran out.
When a patrol officer pulled him over for a traffic violation in 1997, the officer looked in the car and found 12 grams of crack cocaine, a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol.
The combination of guns and drugs was his undoing: Under a new program aimed at gun offenders called Project Exile, prosecutors were able to charge Smith in the tougher federal system.
He is now serving 16 and a half years in a federal prison.
As cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets, Project Exile is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime rates in Richmond by moving gun offenses into the federal system, where bond is less available, sentences are longer and convicts are sent out of state to serve their terms.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has always understood the importance of developing a long-term, stable, and good-neighborly friendship with Mongolia, and any changes in Mongolia's political system and government will not affect China's consistent and friendly policies toward the country.
Tuyaa said that one principal guideline of the Mongolian government is to develop relations of friendship and cooperation with China, and Mongolia will work together with China to assure healthy Mongolia-China good-neighborly relations of long-term stability and mutual trust.
Describing Li's visit to Mongolia in 1994 as important for the smooth development of bilateral relations, Jasray said that the treaty on bilateral friendship and cooperation is functioning as the political and legal basis for bilateral relations.
He also noted that Mongolia is glad to see the marked development of bilateral economic and trade relations in the past few years, and the smooth development of bilateral economic cooperation, especially China's investment in Mongolia.
China's economic aid to Mongolia has also played an important role in the economic development of Mongolia, according to Jasray.
In his first speech published after he took office late last month, Amarjargal said it is the call of the times to add economic diplomacy to the work of the ministry, for the economic relations between Mongolia and other countries bear a special significance for Mongolia's further development.
He continued that Mongolia admires China for its achievements in developing its economy and raising its people's living standards, and appreciates China's aid to Mongolia.

&HT;    First auto designated a 2000 likely to be a Neon &HT;    By Linda Sharp &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ The first automobile to carry the year 2000 on its registration papers is likely to be the redesigned Dodge/Plymouth Neon.
Other manufacturers have announced 2000-model-year products, but with the first 2000 Neons being shipped to retailers this month, the DaimlerChrysler-built compact should go down in the record books as the first 2000 to take to the roads.
Conceived in '94 to target the Generation X market segment, Neon now claims to be ``grown up but not old.''
With a base price of $12,890, Neon boasts about its roominess, affordability, fun and refinement.
Neon has included as standard those options most frequently ordered in the past.
``D'' package buyers will get AM/FM/cassette with six speakers, four cup holders, a 60/40 fold-down split rear seat, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, visor vanity mirror, floor mats and a trunk light.
For an additional $1,760, ``G'' package purchasers get remote keyless entry, theft alarm, tilt steering, cruise control, power windows and door locks, and air conditioning.
Optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, traction control and alloy wheels are also offered.
Cab-forward design Outside, Neon shares the cab-forward design pioneered by Chrysler.
A new rear-end and taillamp treatment along with more prominent wheel arches add to a more substantial appearance.

(Updates, adds quotes) (jt) By NEIL A. LEWIS c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
At the same time, a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8, an action that may make it more difficult for the Justice Department to put its plan into effect.
Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost their court fight.
As a result, the officials said, they were considering revoking an earlier decision allowing Elian to live with the relatives in Miami who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea in November.
Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to resolve the situation.
But Justice Department officials warned that they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts to return Elian to his father.
Up to now, the relatives and their lawyers have said repeatedly that they would not violate any laws in their efforts to keep Elian in the United States.
But they have declined to be more specific and to comply with the Justice Department's demand.
Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said in an interview, ``We have said and we continue to affirm that the family will obey the law.''
But asked if that means that the family agrees to accept sending Elian back if the courts rule against them, Coffey said that he was ``reluctant to speak to that because we are far from that moment.''

(jw) By JAMES BROOKE c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service MONTREAL _ With popular support for Quebec's independence in remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada made a bold gamble with his country's future last week, introducing legislation that lays out Canada's first road map for national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will never follow it.
The new legislation, which requires a ``clear majority'' voting on a ``clear question'' on secession, is the direct outgrowth of what many Canadians now call their nation's ``near death experience,'' the 1995 Quebec referendum that unity forces won by a margin of just 1 percent.
Since that high point for separation, polls in Quebec indicated this fall that support for independence receded to a 10-year low, around 40 percent.
At the same time, popular support for the separatists' provincial government, headed by Premier Lucien Bouchard, fell to the lowest point in its five-year history, around 37 percent.
In a new poll commissioned by Actualite magazine, 74 percent of Quebec residents interviewed predicted that their province would remain in Canada ``forever.''
Giving unity a nudge, Bill Clinton and Jacques Chirac, leaders of the two foreign countries that the people of Quebec most care about, the United States and France, came to Quebec this fall and pointedly praised Canada's federal system of government.
Public opinion in Quebec is known to be volatile, as allies reminded Chretien when he prepared his ``clarity'' legislation in recent weeks.
The veteran prime minister, who entered politics when John F. Kennedy was in the White House, said he knew best.

NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is reviewing its public health act in order to meet the challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the People Daily said Tuesday.
The reviewed act will create an enabling and conducive environment in the fight against the killing disease, Kenyan Minister of Public Health Sam Onger Monday told a sub-regional meeting of the United Nations Theme Groups on International Partnership against HIV/AIDS in Africa.
The new act will address a wide range of issues concerning environmental, sanitary and housing problems, Onger was quoted as saying.
It will also address the current loopholes which encourage the spread of the deadly disease, the minister added.
Since the first case of AIDS was discovered in Kenya in 1984, 1.9 million of the over 30 million Kenyans have been affected by the virus.
It is estimated that some 500 Kenyans die of AIDS-related diseases every day.
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Ministry has warned that an upsurge in malaria cases is likely to happen in west Kenya due to the impending rainy season, the East African Standard daily reported on Friday.
The situation now is not worrying but things can deteriorate with the onset of the rains, Kenya's Director of Medical Service Richard Muga was quoted as saying on Thursday.
"We have put our staff on alert due to possibilities of an outbreak of the malaria epidemic," he said.
According to the official, medical supplies to contain the disease have been sent to the malaria-prone districts.

By PHILIP J. HILTS c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service After a long and contentious hearing in Congress Thursday, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House Government Reform committee, who agreed on little else, agreed to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to set up an extensive, impartial study of whether vaccination may cause a small number of causes of autism.
The agreement came after arguments among witnesses and sparring between leaders of the House Government Reform Committee, in which the hearing was held.
The hearing was called by Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., whose granddaughter has autism, and who believes she may have got it from a vaccine _ even though current research has not found any connection between getting vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella, and the onset of the brain disorder, autism.
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking minority leader on the committee, prodded witnesses and complained to Burton that the hearing was unfairly stacked to show a connection.
He said that while getting the science right was important, in this case getting parents to mistrust vaccines would certainly lead to deaths from diseases society has mostly beaten.
Mainstream medical organizations and leaders in the field of immunization agree that there is no convincing evidence for the theory that the vaccine called MMR _ measles, mumps and rubella _ causes autism, a brain disorder characterized by an inability to socialize and a tendency to engage in constantly repeated actions or comments.
The leading proponent of the idea that MMR vaccine may cause some cases of autism is Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free and University College Medical School in London.
He said he took his cue from parents whose experience of autism seemed to be different than the usual.
The disease is suspected in most cases of being genetic, and it appears gradually in the first two years of life as a failure to speak, the beginning of repetitive motions, and a withdrawal from social interaction.
But the parents Wakefield dealt with said it came on rather suddenly, over a period of months, and often just after vaccination with the triple vaccine.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Friday that additional studies must be completed before his agency can determine the cause of the EgyptAir 990 crash, and he disputed an Associated Press report that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately.
Three government officials close to the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said examinations of the jet's remains have revealed no signs of a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to crash, AP reported Thursday.
``No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted,'' Hall said Friday in a statement.
``There is much that still needs to be done before a determination of cause can be reached.''
The AP story did not report that any hypothesis had been officially adopted by the safety agency.
One official told AP that the Boeing 767 showed no signs of mechanical problems and that ``it was doing what it was supposed to,'' before the crash.
Asked about Hall's statement, the official said Friday night that he stood by his original account.
Two other officials said the working theory remains the plane was sent into a dive shortly after takeoff from New York's Kennedy Airport.
Attempts to contact those two officials Friday night for comment on Hall's statement were not successful.
Hall said the NTSB and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority had agreed this week to continue studying the accident, including the voice and data recorders.

&HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service MEXICO CITY _ Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will be in Mexico on July 2 to observe this country's highly competitive presidential election, an elections monitoring groups said Tuesday.
The invitation to Carter came during an exploratory visit last week by representatives of the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based non-profit group concerned with democracy and that has observed elections in more than a dozen countries in this hemisphere.
``These elections are a watershed for Mexico,'' Carter said in a statement.
``The purpose of our mission is to assess the state of the electoral process, and to demonstrate by our presence and activities the confidence of the international community in the Mexican people's commitment to free and fair elections.''
Emory University professor Robert Pastor, principle advisor to the delegation, said during the center's exploratory visit in Mexico allegations of vote-buying, coercion and other pre-election irregularities were raised by parties trying to unseat Mexico's ruling party.
``These are legitimate concerns we are looking at,'' Pastor said.
But, he added, ``it's not enough to have anecdotes.''
Mexico has gone through sweeping electoral reforms since its last presidential election in 1994.
Polls are showing that the two top candidates in the race are Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party (PAN).
``The presidential election looks to be a very close race,'' Pastor said.

But while the research, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, established the inverse relationship, the authors found in questioning study participants that there was no ``significant relationship'' between the amount of vitamin C that people ate and their blood-lead levels.
Researchers from the University of California at San Francisco studied data collected from 19,578 participants, ages 6 through 90, who did not have a history of lead poisoning.
The participants had taken part in a national health survey from 1988 to 1994.
Co-author of the study, Dr. Joel S. Simon, said that previous studies have found increased dietary amounts of vitamin C linked with lower blood-lead levels.
He said that his and his colleagues' inability to find a dietary relationship may have been attributable to ``imprecise'' questionnaire wording.
He also suggested that high lead levels flush ascorbic acid out of the system more quickly, lowering the ascorbic acid level in the blood.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Star Wars'' prequel is setting box-office records, but it is not alone.
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was North America's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, bringing in $64.8 million for a total gross of $205 million in a record 13 days.
``Independence Day'' set the previous record in 21 days in 1996.
But another kind of star power -- Julia Roberts -- helped ``Notting Hill'' pull in $27.8 million, the biggest opening ever for a romantic comedy.
``The Wedding Singer,'' with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, earned $21.9 million in three days last year.
The comparable three-day figure for ``Notting Hill'' was $22.2 million.
``Star Wars'' locked up the children's audience and the ``thrill ride'' fans, studio executives said, while the love story between Ms. Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British bookstore owner drew an older crowd for second place.
Still, the ``Star Wars'' film is flying.
It already holds records for opening day and five-day totals, and is the fastest to break the $100 million barrier (five days).
``The movie's like a thoroughbred.

ROCKVILLE, Md.
(AP) -- Mike Tyson will learn Wednesday whether he'll lose privileges and time off for good behavior for hurling a TV during an outburst in jail.
The former heavyweight champion faces a closed hearing at Montgomery County (Md.)
Correction Center that day and a ruling will be announced then, the county's Department of Corrections said Monday.
Department spokesman Eric Seleznow said jail officials cited Tyson for destruction of property, assault on correctional staff and disorderly conduct.
A disciplinary panel will determine Tyson's level of responsibility.
Penalties could include loss of privileges and credit for good behavior in time served.
The 32-year-old boxer has been in an isolation cell since Friday, when he tossed a television set against jail bars in an inmate recreation area.
He reportedly became agitated when a guard hung up a telephone he was using.
``Officials have three working days to have a hearing to consider all the facts relevant to the incident,'' Seleznow said.

LONDON (AP) -- Global warming could fundamentally transform a third of the world's plant and animal habitats by the end of this century, threatening many species with rapid extinction, an international conservation organization warned Wednesday.
In a new report, researchers for the World Wide Fund for Nature -- known as the World Wildlife Fund in the United States and Canada -- singled out the Arctic and northern latitudes as the most vulnerable to the changing climate.
They estimated 20 percent of the species there could die out due to shrinking habitat.
The report raises the specter of a tundra denuded of its walrus and polar bear populations and a New England stripped of its spruce and fir forests if the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Many scientists believe that high concentrations of CO2 and other so-called greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures and changing weather patterns.
''As global warming accelerates, plants and animals will come under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat,'' said the report's co-author, Adam Markham, executive director of the U.S.-based group Clean Air-Cool Planet.
''Some will just not be able to move fast enough,'' Markham said.
The northern latitudes of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where climate change is expected to occur fastest, could lose 70 percent of their habitat -- a level that rises to 82 percent for Iceland.
In several countries -- including Russia, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia -- and in seven Canadian provinces and territories, more than half the existing habitat is at risk, the report said.
More than a third of habitat is in danger in the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, it said.

<SLUG> BC-Iraq-UN </SLUG> Iraq rejects contention that it used loaded VX on missiles &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq rejected as a fabrication Tuesday the contention by U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein, said U.N. inspectors were using the issue to prolong the U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.
The statements ``are a part of a dubious fabrication,'' the statement read on state-run television said.
A second round of tests on the missile warheads did not provide further conclusive evidence that Iraq loaded VX on the missiles, although there were signs that Iraq had cleaned the pieces between the initial U.S. tests in April and the tests in June and July.
Despite the lack of additional proof, U.N. and chemical weapons experts from seven countries said they were still satisfied with the initial tests in April that the Iraqis had used the VX for warheads.
Saadi, the mastermind of Iraq's chemical weapons program, reiterated earlier Iraqi claims that Baghdad never succeeded in stabilizing the VX gas and turning it into a weapon.
Saadi said the conclusion of U.N. experts contradicts scientific fact and is ``full of disgraceful scientific fallacies.''
Saadi said Iraq never tampered with the warheads.
Any attempt would have been observed by U.N. monitors in Baghdad who keep the warhead fragments under camera surveillance, he said.
U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction _ and the missiles to deliver them _ before the 15-member Security Council will lift the sanctions.

By ROBERT MATTHEWS Copyright 1999 New Scientist A study of changes in wind patterns linked to global warming over the past 50 years suggests they are slowing the planet's daily spin by around half a millisecond every century.
These effects open up a new way of tracking the progress of global warming without the uncertainties in simple temperature measurements.
Ocean currents associated with El Nio are already known to make equatorial winds blow faster and boost the angular momentum of the atmosphere.
Momentum must be conserved, so the atmosphere steals momentum from the Earth's rotation, making it spin more slowly.
Satellite observations showed that last year's El Nio made days drag on by an extra 0.4 milliseconds.
Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might have a similar effect.
Computer models of the effects of warming point to the appearance of jets of fast-moving wind between the troposphere and stratosphere, roughly 12 kilometers above the Earth's surface.
These would also boost the angular momentum of the atmosphere, triggering a compensating slowing down in the Earth.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Citing their historical relevance and the public's right to know, a judge ordered the release of thousands of secret grand jury papers in the Cold War-era perjury case against Alger Hiss.
The 50-year-old papers are thought to reveal key information about one of the most disputed episodes of the era.
Hiss, a key government aide, was accused of spying for the Soviet Union in 1948, but was tried on perjury charges when the statute of limitations for espionage expired.
He was sent to prison for three years in 1951 and died in 1996 at age 92, still maintaining his innocence.
``Access to such information inevitably enhances the accuracy of history and undermines the false conspiracy theories and revisionism that tend to arise when information remains secret,'' U.S. District Judge Peter Leisure said in his ruling Thursday.
The decision could give historians a legal precedent to open grand jury records in other significant cases.
Grand jury proceedings are normally secret.
Hiss' son, Tony, praised the judge's ruling, saying his father hoped ``the full truth would be disclosed and people could see for themselves that he had always been an honorable and patriotic public servant.''
The federal government fought hard to keep the 3,500 pages of testimony secret.
Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, said prosecutors had not decided whether to appeal.

By ERIC BRAZIL c.2000 San Francisco Examiner SAN FRANCISCO _ The threatened red-legged frog, which is believed to be the inspiration for Mark Twain's short story ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' is about to get extra protection from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
Bowing to an order from U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, the agency on Friday proposed that 5.4 million acres in 31 California counties be designated as a critical habitat for the frog.
``It's the biggest area that we've ever designated in California,'' said Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Patricia Foulk.
The red-legged frog reaches 5 inches in length and is the largest native frog in the West.
It breeds in wetlands, streams, ponds and stock ponds, but its historic range has diminished by 70 percent.
Just four areas in the state harbor more than 350 adult red-legged frogs.
The entire San Mateo County coast and most of West Marin, where some of the largest populations of red-legged frogs live, are designated as a critical habitat in the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal.
Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal permits _ usually from the Army Corps of Engineers _ for their projects.

MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will not leave Russia for a visit before the presidential election scheduled for March 26, said a top Kremlin official Tuesday.
A visit to China will be the first trip abroad of a new Russian president, Sergei Prikhodko, deputy chief of the Kremlin staff told press after Putin's meeting with visiting vice chairman of the Chinese Central Military Council, Defense Minister Chi Haotian in the Kremlin.
Prikhodko said that "in compliance with the existing practice in Russia, prime minister and president do not leave the country at the same time, and therefore it will be difficult for Vladimir Putin" to make trips overseas before the upcoming general election.
"Besides, Vladimir Putin considers it necessary to concentrate on complex issues of domestic policy of Russia," stressed the president's aide.
He added that there was a broad program of events with the participation of Vladimir Putin on the territory of Russia.
"There will be a lot of such affairs," he said.
MOSCOW (AP) -- A string of victories in parliament have solidified President Vladimir Putin's authority and appear to be setting the stage for a calmer, more conciliatory era in Russia after the frenzied confusion of the Boris Yeltsin years.
Since taking office as acting president in December, Putin has persuaded once-combative lawmakers to do two things they steadfastly refused to do under Yeltsin: approve the START II nuclear disarmament treaty and fire Russia's top prosecutor.
Lawmakers also approved the nuclear test ban treaty on Friday at Putin's urging.
''He looks invincible.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House came down solidly behind the Boy Scouts Wednesday with a 362-12 vote against a proposal to revoke their eight-decade-old federal charter because of the scouting organization's policy of excluding gays.
Republicans, who brought the legislation to the House floor to show the lack for support for critics of the Scouts, labeled it an attack on American values.
Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said half the members of the House were former Scouts and would defend an organization ''as American as apple pie and baseball.''
While the bill's opponents accused its few Democratic supporters of extremism, Democrats complained that the GOP's only intent was to embarrass them.
Fifty Democrats and one Republican voted ''present'' in apparent protest of the procedure.
One Republican, Rep. James Greenwood of Pennsylvania, voted for the bill.
David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights organization, said Republicans were ''trying to change the subject from hate crimes to Boy Scouts.''
The GOP leadership is resisting Democratic attempts to pass hate crimes legislation this year.
Beyond the politics, the legislation offered by Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., spotlighted the uneasy relationship between the federal government and the Boy Scouts since the organization's stance toward gays became a national issue.
Woolsey said she was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout.

(sw) By KEITH BRADSHER c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service DETROIT _ Nearly 6,000 workers went on strike on Thursday evening at a General Motors spark plug and speedometer factory in Flint, Mich., joining fellow strikers at a nearby GM plant in an increasingly bitter fight that could close all of the leading automaker's North American assembly plants within days.
GM had already closed seven of those assembly plants and temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts from the initial strike last Friday at a metal-stamping plant in Flint.
Most of GM's other 22 assembly plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico are now expected to quickly run out of the spark plugs, speedometers and other parts made by the giant factory where workers walked out on Thursday night.
Angry over what they called unmet demands for job security and improved health and safety conditions, hundreds of workers chanting ``UAW!''
and toting red placards identifying their local union unit mobbed the spark plug factory's gates on Thursday evening.
They were joined by workers from the metal-stamping factory, who struck over the same issues.
Scattered among the picketers were UAW members from across Michigan and even Ohio and Illinois who had come to show their anger at GM, which has contended with steadily worsening labor relations in trying to make its factories run as efficiently as those of competitors.
GM said in a terse statement that it was disappointed by the broadening of the strike to a second parts factory.

MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
On Friday, seven guerrillas attacked an Interior Ministry forces post in the Chechen capital Grozny, using rifles and grenade launchers, Interfax quoted military sources as saying.
There were no casualties among the Russians.
According to an unconfirmed report, a military post in the Argun district came under fire on Saturday, Interfax said.
"The clash went on for quite a long time," a military source was quoted as saying.
Another unconfirmed report said a Chechen vehicle had tried to break into Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes.
The governor of the Russian-controlled Nadterechnaya district said Russian security and police forces carried out a special operation on Saturday and detained 11 suspects.
The governor, Akhmed Zavgayev, told Interfax he could not confirm a report that a bomb had been found in Znamenskoye, a district center.
Russian federal troops beefed up security in the breakaway republic in the run-up to Sunday's elections.
A travel ban was imposed from Friday through Monday to ward off possible rebel threats to stage terrorist attacks and sabotage.

LONDON (AP) -- After linking El Nino with illnesses such as malaria, cholera and dengue fever, scientists now have connected the climatic phenomenon with an increase in childhood diarrhea.
The research led by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health also suggests for the first time that gradual temperature increases related to global warming could foster outbreaks of diarrhea in children living in developing nations.
Diarrhea kills as many as 3 million children under the age of 5 worldwide every year and sickens millions more, mostly in developing countries.
It normally is more prevalent during the warmer seasons but, until now, experts didn't know whether a change in temperature could play a role.
The study of 57,331 children in Lima, Peru, found that an increase in diarrhea cases between 1993 and 1997 was linked to even small rises in temperature, regardless of whether it was summer or winter.
In fact, the effect was greater in winter, even though the weather was cooler.
Overall, the study, published this week in The Lancet medical journal, found that for every 1 degree centigrade (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than normal it became, 8 percent more children arrived at a local clinic for treatment of diarrhea.
The findings were similar for the 1997-1998 El Nino period.
The number of children brought to the clinic each day that winter was double what would have been expected for that time of year had El Nino not occurred, the study found.
El Nino, which involves the equatorial waters in the Pacific warming up, creating unusual weather patterns around the world, increased winter temperatures in Lima by about 4 degrees centigrade (about 7 degrees Fahrenheit).

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News LOS ANGELES -- The evacuation of an apartment complex Friday because of an unexploded, stolen air bag reveals what police say is a thriving, illegal trade in these car safety devices.
In L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, investigators suspect there is at least one roving gang of thieves that specializes in taking orders from body shops and then going out to steal them.
Nationwide, an estimated $50 million worth of air bags are stolen every year, accounting for 10 percent of all auto theft claims in 1997, double that of just the year before, insurance industry officials said.
``It's basically a replacement for the car stereo theft of the '80s and early '90s,'' said Julie Rochman, spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, based in Arlington, Va. ``The air bags the thieves are going after are worth more than any other item in the passenger compartment.''
Following a crash, a new air bag can cost $1,000, but police said unscrupulous body shops buy stolen ones for $150 apiece and then charge $1,500, including the installation.
And removing an explosively armed air bag, particularly if it is done in a hurry, can leave a car in bad shape.
``When air bags are stolen, they damage the steering wheel, the dash or cut the wiring harness,'' said Frank Tomota, a service consultant at West Valley Toyota in Northridge.
Insurance premiums are not expected to rise because officials said the growing cost of air bag thefts is offset by an overall decline in auto thefts.
The real losers are the motorists because with every theft, they must pay the deductible amount, arrange for the repairs and risk driving without an air bag.
The air bag that was found unexploded in Van Nuys on Friday is among the 12 or so that police said are stolen every month in the Valley.
