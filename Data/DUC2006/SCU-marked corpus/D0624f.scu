that victims themselves should decide what offenses are and are not racially motivated; that individuals acquitted of one crime may sometimes be retried for the same one - it has already announced it will toughen Britain's anti-racism laws and act to cleanse the police.</line><line>Why such public and parliamentary outrage?</line><line>That, &quot;The Color of Justice&quot; made clear along its trip from Kilburn to the Theater Royal in the East London district of Stratford, in a showing on the BBC, and at the Victoria Palace in the West End.</line><line>The play consists of extracts of evidence given to the Macpherson inquiry and edited by the journalist and dramatist Richard Norton-Taylor.</line><line>In performance, it seemed as fresh as the O.J. Simpson trial and yet as old in its implications as Aeschylus' &quot;Oresteia.&quot;</line><line>As more than one critic suggested, the play vitally concerns the health not just of society's custodians but of society itself.</line><line>The Tricycle has long reflected the special nature of Kilburn, which is sometimes thought to be the most culturally mixed urban area in Europe.</line><line>It has given world or British premieres to plays by black writers - including Mustapha Matura's &quot;Playboy of the West Indies,&quot; the work of the American August Wilson and several imports from the Market Theater in Johannesburg - and to many works by Irish writers.</line><line>The theater also has plenty of experience in documentary drama.</line><line>Recently, it staged extracts from the Nuremberg trials, from hearings at the Hague into war crimes in Bosnia, and from an official inquiry into British arms exports to Iraq..</line><line>In Nicolas Kent's production of &quot;The Color of Justice,&quot; as in those pieces, everything was so matter-of-fact that you felt you were not in a place of entertainment but the gallery Sir William reserved for the public.</line><line>The lawyers sat in gray pews in front of boxed files and video screens.</line><line>People wandered in, whispered, dropped pens, chewed nibs, yawned, wandered out.</line><line>The downbeat tone extended to the witnesses.</line><line>Actors who didn't look at all like actors described in bald, banal yet riveting words the investigation Sir William has now condemned so unequivocally.</line><line>Prodded by the Lawrences' silkily menacing counsel, Jeremy Clyde's Michael Mansfield, and the other attorneys, the witnesses confronted question after question.</line><line>Did the police who originally arrived on the scene assume Stephen was a hoodlum himself?</line><line>Why didn't they give him first aid or instantly start a proper hue and cry?</line><line>Why weren't the suspects arrested far earlier than they were?</line><line>Why did camera surveillance begin just too late to record one of them taking a trash bag crammed with clothes from his house?</line><line>Why have so many police notes disappeared?</line><line>How much did it matter that one investigating officer had a decidedly unprofessional relationship with a drug baron who was also a suspect's father?</line><line>Norton-Taylor did not alter a single word of the inquiry's transcript and added nothing of his own; however he did cut the 11,000 pages of evidence to a 100-page script.</line><line>The audience heard endless quibbles about what is and isn't a racial attack, as well as a junior officer earnestly claiming to &quot;understand black people&quot; because she was raised in Africa.</line><line>A very senior policeman offered a fulsome apology to the Lawrences for his force's failures and, using a word the inquiry had already deemed inappropriate, went on to justify the disproportionately frequent arrest of blacks because &quot;colored people&quot; tend to live in high-crime areas.</line><line>The suspects were subpoenaed by the inquiry, but only one was seen in the play.</line><line>He failed to remember being shown a police surveillance video in which his brother and their friends violently brandish knives and speak in obscene terms of their desire to dismember blacks.</line><line>The good samaritan, whose wife cradled the dying student, whispering &quot;you are loved&quot; into his ear, admitted he initially wondered if the boy was a mugger faking a collapse.</line><line>After the murder, he washed his bloodstained hands and poured the water on a rosebush in his garden, &quot;So in a way, I suppose, he is kind of living on a bit.&quot;</line><line>It is impossible not to feel that in other, subtler yet more substantial ways, Stephen really is.</line><line>Is it crazy to claim that, when they gathered to see a jury of Athenians decide how much responsibility Orestes had for his mother's death, Aeschylus' audiences were in a parallel predicament to those at &quot;The Color of Justice&quot;?</line><line>It is not merely that effective drama has often been forensic in content and style and has concerned itself with trying to root out difficult truths.</line><line>It is that an effective theater should regularly
