said Frank Kramer, owner of the esteemed Harvard Book Store in Cambridge.</line><line>&quot;We want the Web to drive people to our store, that's the goal.</line><line>The fact is, we have tremendous potential on the Internet and could increase our sales tremendously, but we enjoy physical retailing.&quot;</line><line>Ken Gloss, owner of the historic Brattle Book Shop, in downtown Boston, takes great pains to ensure that walk-in customers get treated as well as his on-line patrons, whose mounting orders take more and more time to process.</line><line>&quot;Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make available in the store first,&quot; Gloss said.</line><line>&quot;We don't want our in-store customers to feel like they're left out.&quot;</line><line>What many proprietors are finding out is that loyal customers were waiting for their chance to enjoy the convenience of on-line shopping without having to buy books from the massive corporate Web sellers like Barnes &amp; Noble's on-line store bn.com.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="25"/></line><line>&quot;I shop on line because it's convenient, because I have to,&quot; said Frances Burke, a professor emeritus at Suffolk University, as she bought a book at Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop.</line><line>&quot;But whenever I get the chance, I come to the bookstore.</line><line>I need to touch and smell the books.&quot;</line><line>As a cradle of the high-tech economy, the Boston area was perhaps destined for the vanguard of on-line book selling.</line><line>Wordsworth.com, created in 1993, was the world's second on-line bookstore, followed closely by Harvard.com, BrooklineBooksmith.com, and a few others.</line><line>But the movement was slow to take off, as shopkeepers either could not afford to create a Web site or saw the creation of one as a violation of their store's identity.</line><line>In January 1996, only 10 shops in the region had Web sites, and two years later, 10 more had joined them.</line><line>Today, however, nearly 150 of the region's 470 independent booksellers, many teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, have Web sites, according to the New England Booksellers Association (NEBA).</line><line>That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, the nation's other storied association of bookstore proprietors.</line><line>&quot;We've seen a six-fold increase in the past two years,&quot; said Wayne &quot;Rusty&quot; Drugan, the NEBA's executive director.</line><line>&quot;It's a groundswell.&quot;</line><line>For some shops, the high-tech effort consists of little more than a few pretty photographs, directions to the store, a telephone number, and some staff recommendations of good reads.</line><line>&quot;I'd have to have a crew of 20 people working constantly to get all my books on the Web site,&quot; said Gloss, whose site holds just a smattering of his collection.</line><line>Lacking the resources to offer millions of titles like Amazon.com, some owners have instead focused on recreating the intangible qualities of their shops on-line.</line><line>McCaffrey has a page devoted to Blue, for instance.</line><line>Gloss offers photos of handsome, leatherbound tomes.</line><line>The virtual bookstores, they admit, are pathetic by comparison with the real thing.</line><line>On &quot;the computer screen, there's no texture, no depth,&quot; Kramer said.</line><line>&quot;I don't care how many graphics you have, it doesn't compare to the table, the shelves, the overstock area, the books at the front counter.</line><line>That has a dimension computer screens cannot accomplish.&quot;</line><line>To make up for the physical shortcomings of the Internet, many storeowners have invested in Web sites that offer depth of stock, on-line ordering, and other conveniences.</line><line>Most now offer search engines that allow surfers to comb entire store inventories, or even to tap into databases of every book in print.</line><line>In effect, many tiny shops on the corner now have the capability of offerring the same number of books as the massive retail chains like Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders, or Amazon.com.</line><line>Wordsworth's general manager, Sanj Kharbanda, said his store's Web site now holds about 1.2 million titles, enough variety to bring in about 125 on-line sales a day.</line><line>That converts to roughly 9 percent of total sales on a given day, he said.</line><line>&quot;In this day and age, the minimum expectation is that we would have a Web site, and being a bookstore, a search function has become a necessary convenience,&quot; Kharbanda said.</line><line>And at the Boston Book Company, which occupies a less-than-glamorous second-floor stie in the city's Jamaica Plain neighborhood, Internet sales now account for half the shop's sales, co-owner Helen Kelly said.</line><line>The reason, she said, is the plentiful title list on the store's Web site.</line><line>Even the slickest home pages, however, seem hopelessly grounded in the physical world, no matter how virtual the shopping experience.</line><line>Few independent booksellers take the time to create customer profiles, or track shoppers' habits, and even fewer have employees dedicated solely to working with on-line customers.</line><line>As Richard Howorth, president of the American Booksellers Association and owner of a small bookstore in Mississippi, said, &quot;I have no idea how many hits I get.&quot;</line><line>Such apparent disdain for mimicking the widely imitated strategies of Amazon.com is apparent in other ways.</line><line>Anirvan Chatterjee, founder of Bookfinder.com, where on-line book buyers browse inventories of thousands of independent bookshops around the world, said on-line book indexes like his have helped independents offer books that appear nowhere on their shelves.</line><line>With such resources available to booksellers who go on-line, there's plenty of financial sense in shuttering storefronts and doing business solely in cyberspace, Chatterjee said.</line><line>But so far, most have kept a foot in the physical world.</line><line>&quot;A lot of sellers are finding that their on-line presence subsidizes their storefront;

for hundreds of individual Web sites created and maintained by local stores.</line><line>Each will have its own Web address and set its own prices.</line><line>What is unusual about Contentville's relationship with the independent booksellers it has recruited - Glenn Goldman of Book Soup in Los Angeles, Neal Sofman of A Clean Well Lighted Place in San Francisco and a former ABA president, Ed Morrow of Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt., among others - is that the independents will not actually be selling books on Contentville.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="14,18"/></line><line>Instead, they will provide editorial content for a fee and will get an equity stake in the company should Contentville go public.</line><line>Sara Farley, an e-commerce analyst at PaineWebber, believes the biggest issue for the new sites lies in customer service, exactly the territory the independents in Booksense.com, in particular, will have the least control over.</line><line>&quot;The trick,&quot; she says, &quot;is providing a great customer experience.</line><line>Amazon has spent five years developing a complicated and hopefully very robust distribution and fulfillment network.</line><line>They didn't snap their fingers.&quot;</line><line>To meet the challenge, the sites have established alliances with Baker &amp;

said Brill.</line><line>Booksense.com has reached similar distribution agreements with Baker &amp; Taylor and other wholesalers.</line><line>The wholesalers' ability to deliver on their promises is crucial, says Lorraine Shanley, a publishing consultant at Market Partners.</line><line>&quot;The online component of bookselling is difficult for people without the resources and organizational savvy of Amazon,&quot;

he says.</line><line>&quot;The larger sites in each area are adding functionality so that people don't need to go to other sites.&quot;</line><line>Booksense.com, which has been delayed since the fall by technical problems, grows out of Booksense, a &quot;national marketing umbrella&quot;
