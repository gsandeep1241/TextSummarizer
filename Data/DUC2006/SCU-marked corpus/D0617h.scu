the captain said, as the plane dropped into the Pacific.</line><line>The flight data recorder later revealed that the instrumentation problem was with three small vents on the side of the plane, known as static ports, which are used to measure air pressure and determine air speed.</line><line>The static ports are crucial because speed cannot be determined visually from a jet flying at high altitude at night, and if a plane flies too fast or too slow, it will crash.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="22"/></line><line>Investigators, zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing the two flight recorders, eventually found that maintenance workers had covered the 757's static ports with protective masking tape when they washed the plane, and had neglected to remove it - an oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from the instruments and flew the plane to its doom.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="18"><scu uid="23" label="Data Black Box recorders was examined" weight="2"/></annotation></line><line>In some cases, however, flight recorders have proved insufficient.</line><line>In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia last year, the recorders have provided no insight into the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air traffic controllers on the ground.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="18,24"/></line></document><document name="NYT19991110.0501"><line>Cruising at 33,000 feet, EgyptAir Flight 990 was &quot;uneventful&quot;
