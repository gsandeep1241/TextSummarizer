Kenneth Starr may have convinced most of America that President Clinton lied under oath, but he would have a difficult time proving in a court of law that the president is guilty of perjury.
The president's lawyer, David Kendall, has said that ``no prosecutor in the United States would bring a perjury prosecution on the basis'' of the kinds of questions Clinton was asked about his sex life in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
Lewinsky, who originally signed an affidavit saying she did not have sexual relations with Clinton, eventually testified before the grand jury that he did touch her body in areas that fell within the definition of sexual relations.
The prosecutors also invoked the case of a Nevada federal judge, Harry E. Claiborne, who was convicted of three articles of impeachment and removed by the Senate in 1986 for filing false income tax returns.
But in his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged being alone with Lewinsky on repeated occasions.
Still, some Democrats have said that even if the worst is true _ that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury _ that is not necessarily an impeachable offense.
On the question of whether he discussed Lewinsky's possible testimony in the Jones case with Lewinsky or Vernon Jordan, White House lawyers argue that Starr and Republicans have pinpointed only the answers that suggest perjury by Clinton.
The Constitution says that impeachment and removal from office are no bar to criminal prosecution afterward.
