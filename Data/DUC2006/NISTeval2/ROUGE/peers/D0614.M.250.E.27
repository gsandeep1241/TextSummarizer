Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80 percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada.
After 30 years of the separatist movement, many Quebecers have developed sophisticated positions on independence that at times can puzzle outsiders A survey released last month found 41 percent of Quebecers would vote "Yes" in a vote on separation.
Earlier this year, in a landmark Canadian Supreme Court case that backfired badly on the federal government, the nation's nine high judges ruled that Canada cannot prevent the secession of Quebec if a "clear majority" of Quebecers opt for independence.
In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when "winning conditions" exist.
It is a paradox that keeps all of Canada in limbo: Most Quebeckers aren't eager for another referendum on secession, yet they seem on the verge of re-electing a government committed to independence.
As surveys showed that Quebecers_for whom Monday's election is the sixth in six years_were overwhelmingly against holding another referendum, Bouchard's position wavered.
Many in English Canada believed that if Charest, a popular federal politician, could win and impose a moratorium on referendums for the next four to five years, he could end or severely impede the separatist movement, whose strength has been diluted by immigration and demographic change.
