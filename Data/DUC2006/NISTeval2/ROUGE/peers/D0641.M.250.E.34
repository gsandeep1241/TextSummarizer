BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ As the hurricane hunter plane swooped low over the ocean on a late October day, white caps and green foam flicked across the tropical waters, giving rise to Mitch.
But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's undue warming.
Environmentalists, too, are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall global warming.
In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark report that ``the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate''.
And a powerful El Nino gave us a taste of the extreme weather we can expect from global warming: droughts and floods in Texas, drought-driven fires in Indonesia, Florida and Mexico, and devastating floods in China,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the top U.S. climate negotiator.
The cloud _ a harbinger of climate change, some call it _ appears as global warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields ranging from atmospheric physics to biology.
``Almost every climate model says the same thing,'' said ocean chemist Peter G. Brewer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Monterey.
In the diverse world of global warming research, the latest projections suggest that: _ Coastal residents can look for rainier weather, and sea levels could rise one to three feet around
