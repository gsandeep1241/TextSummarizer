Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya.
Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts on October 12th, 1999, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants.
Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen criminals.
They detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to re-enter Chechnya.
Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections.
Chechen rebels committed five terrorist blasts in several key cities of the war-torn republic Sunday night, killing at least 36 Russian servicemen and wounding 74.
Chechen rebels have staged a fresh wave of terrorists acts since Russian troops launched a large-scale mopping-up campaign against the militants in late June, especially after federal units annihilated a 200-250 strong gang of Arab mercenaries near central Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt.
The casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels have reached over 100.
