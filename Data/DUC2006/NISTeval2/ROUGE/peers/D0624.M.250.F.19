At the end of The Color of Justice, Michael Culver's self-effacing, punctilious Macpherson echoed what the real Sir William did at the end of the first inquiry.
LONDON, March 1 ( Xinhua ) Police forces in England and Wales were failing to eradicate racial prejudice in their ranks, a government inspector's report said on Monday.
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted institutional racism in London's Metropolitan Police following the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
Straw, setting out the government's point-by-point response to the Lawrence report, said his plan of action should bring about real, practical change.
The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south-east London in 1993.
The Independent: The five men suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence were thumped and pelted with bottles by an enraged crowd Tuesday after a day of evasive and implausible evidence that made a mockery of their appearance before the public inquiry.
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week.
The reports cast a new cloud over race relations in Britain, already strained after the police force was found to be racist following its bungled investigation into the 1993 murder of black youth Stephen Lawrence.
