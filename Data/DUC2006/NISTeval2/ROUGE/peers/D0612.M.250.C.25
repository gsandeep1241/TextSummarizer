The symptoms of autism range from mild to severe, making the true incidence of the disorder difficult to assess, said Dr Marie Bristol-Power, who coordinates autism research at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md.
By studying the anatomy of autistic brains, researchers are trying to figure out when in development and where in the brain the complex interaction of genes and environment causes things to go astray.
Researchers need to look at many more babies, he said, to see exactly which movement abnormalities can predict autism and which suggest developmental disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit disorder.
'' The major question for me is whether it 's just more prevalent ( than previously thought ) or it 's on the rise, '' as some parents and doctors suspect, said Dr Eric London, vice president of medical affairs at the National Alliance for Autism Research in Princeton and a consultant for the investigation.
