The vouchers allow low-income families to find their own housing, and to use government subsidies to help pay the costs.
About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is the development of prisons, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995, when the Republican Party took control of Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget.
Because the federal government has stopped funding new affordable housing, local agencies are finding other ways to meet their needs.
The Housing Authority buys a third of the units in that 15 percent to rent as subsidized housing.
HUD says people should not spend more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing.
A major part of the problem, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in Massachusetts.
The public housing bill has been pressed mainly by congressional Republicans over the opposition of Democrats and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who have said that the Republican bill would leave poor people without housing.
Cuomo is also on the verge of winning enactment of two other housing measures that are likely to make it easier for congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration to accept the public housing bill.
Nearly 3 million households receive housing vouchers.
