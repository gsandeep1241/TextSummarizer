There are currently 42,000 housing units in the West Bank and Gaza, Peace Now leader Mosi Raz said.
The army said it sent the request to settlements that don't have a security fence yet.
Palestinian officials said that eight new mobile homes set up in a remote area of the West Bank, half a mile from the nearest community, is a new settlement and a violation of peace accords.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers east of Tel Aviv.
Nachman said raising the status of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now.
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that the eu decision is "unfair" and would be "harmful" to reviving the Middle East peace process.
There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Israel holds that its policy to expand existing settlements has nothing to do with the agreement.
It is called city instead of settlement now.
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
One month after a ceremonial start, Israel has yet to name its negotiators in the final status talks, in which the fate of the Jewish settlements will be dealt with.
