WASHINGTON _ Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's Navy sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
The other submarine was the Memphis, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based in Groton, Conn., and one of two American submarines spying on the largest Russian naval exercise in years when disaster struck the Kursk on the morning of Aug. 12.
By the time the Memphis reached Bergen, Norway, officials in Russia had said that the Kursk probably had sunk after colliding with either a foreign submarine or a World War II mine.
Publicly, the Pentagon still refuses to comment on the whereabouts or the mission of the Memphis, but some officials now acknowledge its spying mission.
And that theory, they said, does not include the collision that the Russians have said probably occurred.
MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision.
The chance of a happy ending, the navy chief conceded, was ''not very high''.
The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear submarines, was apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of feet to the sea floor near the Arctic Circle on Sunday, naval commander Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov said.
Russian officials said the vessel was carrying no nuclear weapons
