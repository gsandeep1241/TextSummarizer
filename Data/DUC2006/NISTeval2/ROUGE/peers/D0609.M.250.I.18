The committee said the money was required because of the recent Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and it would be used for infrastructure work in order to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
The decision came one day after the Knesset ratified the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord with a landslide majority, paving the way for the start of Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
Barak said his decision was based on the recommendations from the defense establishment, which found that settlers have established 42 encampments throughout the West Bank since the signing of the Wye River peace accord last fall and their legalities were all in question.
Palestinians, infuriated by Netanyahu's pledge of more Jewish settlements, complain that the Jewish settlements have broken up the territories between their main cities and diminished their chances of establishing an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting the Middle East peace process, also revealed that there are still 5,892 new housing units now under construction in various settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement expansion.
The army has asked Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to build fences around their communities, a proposal settler leaders rejected Tuesday as ineffective and an obstacle to future expansion.
