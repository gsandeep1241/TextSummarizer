NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
As part of an extended mission, Galileo's instruments are studying the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic properties of Io, Jupiter's innermost large moon and the only known actively volcanic solar system object besides Earth.
"Until now, we thought Callisto was a dead and boring moon, just a hunk of rock and ice," said space physicist Margaret Kivelson of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has been using Galileo's magnetometer to measure electric currents flowing from Jupiter for nearly three years.
Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
images of icebergs on the icy crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft it the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow and brown matter that many scientists argue.
The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled.
A team of researchers investigating the powerful magnetic field reported Wednesday a sophisticated instrument aboard spacecraft has on the two Jovian moons.
