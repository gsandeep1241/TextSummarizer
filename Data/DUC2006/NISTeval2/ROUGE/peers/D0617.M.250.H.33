WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public release of reports compiling the facts in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last fall off the New England coast.
_ A submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday, bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
``There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
In the documents, which were made public on Friday in the U.S. and presented on the website of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Kato did not give credence to a theory that the plane was downed by a missile, but stressed the need to investigate fully what the Flight 990 crew might have seen.
