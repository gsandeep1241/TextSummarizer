Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
On one level, Quebecers of many political stripes believe that it is entirely up to their provincial legislature to set the rules for a referendum that would decide the political future of Quebec, Canada's largest province.
Quebec insists that any decision on independence must be made only by the people of Quebec.
The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30-year-fight for independence was a risky strategy for the federal government because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
What Chretien is seeking is a federal law that would not forbid Quebec or any other province from seceding, but would lay down formal rules, including that the process take place "in consultation" with the rest of Canada and only after a vote in which a "clear majority" of Quebecers choose independence.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
