In 1998 Detroit had 429 murders, or 44.2 per 100,000 people, ranking it sixth among U.S. cities with more than 100,000 residents.
Chicago is expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.
Even law enforcement-oriented sources note that increase in police staffing levels and hard-line enforcement and prosecution policies fail to totally account for falling crime rates.
Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in the nation's crack cocaine problem, which is associated with large increase in violence crime among young people in the 1980s.
Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher sentences and more police officers on the street.
