This election is about a quality government for Quebec.
The last referendum, in 1995, fell just 50,000 votes short of authorizing Quebec to negotiate its way out of Canada.
Charest says there will be no referendum if he is premier.
In his campaign, Charest has accused Bouchard of recklessly pursuing another referendum even though opinion polls show that Quebecers overwhelmingly oppose it.
Polls consistently show that Quebecers are sick of referendums on independence.
To French Quebecers, separatism is one issue among many.
During the campaign, Bouchard attacked Charest relentlessly and raised doubts about how well he really knew Quebec, since Charest had been away from the province for so long, Morton said.
Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold another referendum in the four to five years of his government if ``winning conditions'' existed.
Voters sided with Bouchard even though the support for separation has declined.
Bouchard refused to rule out completely the possibility of holding another vote on separation.
In a 1995 referendum on independence, the restive province of Quebec came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging Canada into its darkest political hour in decades.
Bouchard never hid his goal of Quebec independence.
News reports said earlier that Bouchard will consider a fall election in Quebec.
The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
People in the province voted to stay in Canada instead of separation in the referendum two.
