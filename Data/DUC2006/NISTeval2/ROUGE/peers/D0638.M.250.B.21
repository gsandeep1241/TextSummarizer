"We've survived much longer than anyone thought we would".
As its engineers like to say, Galileo has kept going "well past its warranty".
Designed to operate two years around Jupiter, the spacecraft was cleared in December 1997 for a mission extension of two more years.
Initial analysis of early data from Galileo probe has encouraged scientists to review their theories of planetary evolution, according to scientists at a NASA press conference Monday.

The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo on July 13 and entered into Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7, was the first man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet and sent back data on its way to demise.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
The data was collected in December 1995 when a probe set loose from the Galileo spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, plunged into the planet's atmosphere.
