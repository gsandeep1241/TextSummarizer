Concerning theories, blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6 to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming the tropics but cooling the polar regions.
The New York Times today quoted the Centers for Disease Control as reporting that a heat wave killed 465 people in Chicago, the United States, alone, and in New York, where heat-related deaths now average 320 per year, three to six times that many might die annually by 2050.
The theory is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, thereby increasing the warming even more.
Concerning arguments, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, over the past century mean global temperatures have increased 0.6 to 1.2 degrees, the global sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches, and the snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and floating ice in the Arctic Ocean have decreased.
The climate debate has usually been portrayed as a polarized argument between believers and contrarians, there is actually a broad spectrum of views among scientists.
