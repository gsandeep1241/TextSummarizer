WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House came down solidly behind the Boy Scouts Wednesday with a 362-12 vote against a proposal to revoke their eight-decade-old federal charter because of the scouting organization's policy of excluding gays.
Republicans, who brought the legislation to the House floor to show the lack for support for critics of the Scouts, labeled it an attack on American values.
Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C.
, said half the members of the House were former Scouts and would defend an organization ''as American as apple pie and baseball''.
While the bill's opponents accused its few Democratic supporters of extremism, Democrats complained that the GOP's only intent was to embarrass them.
Fifty Democrats and one Republican voted ''present'' in apparent protest of the procedure.
One Republican, Rep. James Greenwood of Pennsylvania, voted for the bill.
David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights organization, said Republicans were ''trying to change the subject from hate crimes to Boy Scouts''.
The GOP leadership is resisting Democratic attempts to pass hate crimes legislation this year.
Beyond the politics, the legislation offered by Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif.
, spotlighted the uneasy relationship between the federal government and the Boy Scouts since the organization's stance toward gays became a national issue.
Woolsey said she was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout.
''We're not saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that intolerance is bad''.
