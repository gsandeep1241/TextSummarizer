Investigators in the Aug. 7 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had made ``great strides,'' having already determined what the bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy.
On Wednesday, police in the island archipelago off the Tanzanian coast raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the embassy bombings.
Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI investigators in Tanzania, said the investigation had made ``great strides.'' An Australian man who was among 14 foreigners arrested in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania has been released, Australian officials said Wednesday.
The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70, while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya killed at least 224 people and injured 5,000.
The other foreigners arrested in Tanzania over the bombing include six Iraqis, six Sudanese and a Turkish citizen.
One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year of planned terrorist attacks against them.
Investigators in the Aug. 7 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had made ``extraordinary discoveries,'' having determined what the bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy.
