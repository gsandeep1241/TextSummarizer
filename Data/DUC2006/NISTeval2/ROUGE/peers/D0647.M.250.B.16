Attorney General Janet Reno earlier Thursday urged those involved in the dispute over the Cuban boy to resolve the situation quickly so the child ``can get on with his life.'' A U.S. appellate court panel sided Thursday with Elian's father in the 6-month-old international custody battle, saying that immigration officials had been entitled to deny an asylum hearing for the boy.
WASHINGTON _ The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
But later, the boy's great-uncle said in Miami that the meeting was off.
The meeting, if it takes place as planned, would end the lengthy custody battle with a peaceful transfer that Attorney General Janet Reno had struggled to piece together.
After the meeting was announced, Justice Department officials expressed satisfaction that the end seemed to be in sight.
The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
It now appears he could go home as early as next week.
