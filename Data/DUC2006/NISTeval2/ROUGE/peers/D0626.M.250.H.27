The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70, while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya killed at least 224 people and injured 5,000.
On Sept. 2, police in the Comoros archipelago, off the Tanzanian coast, raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the bombings.
Two suspects held in connection with the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania will be charged in a local court next week, a newspaper said Saturday.
Fazil, Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, the other suspect charged in the Kenyan bombing, are believed to be members of the al-Qaeda organization founded by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.
One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year of planned terrorist attacks against them.
While living in Kenya from 1994 to last year, Ahmed's life paralleled that of Wahid el Hage, who was indicted last week in New York and has been accused of working with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier whom the United States believes was behind the embassy bombings.
