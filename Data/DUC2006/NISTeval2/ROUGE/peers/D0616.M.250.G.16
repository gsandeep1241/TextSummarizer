GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Russian officials have said repeatedly that Chechen claims of civilian casualties are exaggerated.
The source said foreign extremists and weaponry are arriving from abroad to aid the Chechen militants, with more than 300 terrorists coming from the Middle East in October, and by orders of field commander Shamil Basayev and Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
They have moved to the villages in the Itum-Kale, Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno districts.
Now the Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population were living.
In Grozny, Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov claimed Sunday that the Russian military conceal their losses in Chechnya.
The Chechen side only lost 32 men, Maskhadov said.
Russian commanders claim that the Chechen rebels' casualties, by most conservative estimates, are at least 1,500.
The Russian military says it is trying to prevent incursions of Islamic militants from Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan.
The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations put the total number of Chechen refugees at over 156,000, Interfax said.
Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to cross into Chechnya.
The militants are fortifying their positions in sparsely populated mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, he said.
Another unconfirmed report said a Chechen vehicle had tried to break into Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes.
