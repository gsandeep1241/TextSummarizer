The B.C. suit alleges that intensive Alaskan interception of Canadian-bound fish this summer violated the basic principles of conservation and share in the Pacific Salmon Treaty.
As it stands now, the habitat conservation plan negotiated by Pacific Lumber and government officials would not only permit the logging of ancient redwoods.
Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon.
Salmon spawn throughout the Pacific Northwest, so any effort to save them will have to be regional in scope.
One reason is that the salmon is not only economically important to the Pacific Northwest but is virtually a cultural icon.
There are also many questions surrounding the federal commitment.
``It's important to us that people understand we're sensitive to the fisheries problems in the Pacific Northwest and we don't want to come off as saying we got salmon and you don't.
Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn in the same locality, like a specific creek.
There is no question that, compared with those fish that have to navigate through the dams, a much higher percentage of salmon survive the barge trip, which drops them off just downstream of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, the last man-made impediment before the fish can reach the Pacific.
