WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6 - year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
MIAMI _ The drama intensified Wednesday in the Elian Gonzalez saga as Cuban President Fidel Castro announced that the boy 's father was ready to fly `` immediately '' to retrieve his son, while the US government extended its deadline for taking action to return the boy to Cuba.
Neither the lawyers nor Elian 's relatives would comment before the judge 's ruling, which is expected early next week.
The plane took off at Washington Dulles International Airport after the US Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal by Elian relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States.
Elian has since lived with his father in the Washington area while awaiting the decision.
HAVANA ( AP ) Cuba on Thursday called a demonstration of a half-million women for Friday morning to protest a US court decision that would keep Elian Gonzalez from returning to his homeland for at least another two weeks.
INTERNATIONAL CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ As both sides in the Elian Gonzales custody case await a federal appeals court ruling, the mayor of Miami flies to Washington to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno.
