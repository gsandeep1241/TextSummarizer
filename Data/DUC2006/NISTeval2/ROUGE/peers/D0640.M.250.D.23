Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, has provided his Russian counterpart with a written summary of what U.S. naval and intelligence officials believe caused the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk to sink on August of 2000 in the Barents Sea.
A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves lashing the Barents Sea near Norway.
The Russian navy struggled to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision.
Fighting heaving, icy seas, Russian rescuers lowered a diving capsule to start evacuating 116 sailors trapped in a sunken Russian nuclear submarine.
Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk.
British rescuers arrived in the area where a Russian nuclear submarine with 118 crew went down a week ago, but Russian officials say chances are very slim now for the survival of those aboard the ill-fated Kursk.
Six days later, another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's Navy sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
Raising the Kursk may be impossible, meaning that its secrets will be lost forever.
