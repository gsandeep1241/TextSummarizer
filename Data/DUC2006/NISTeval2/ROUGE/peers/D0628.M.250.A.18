Gold said that part of the difficulty of diagnosis of a psychiatric disease, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is that there are other kinds of problems that cause children to have problems sitting still or to concentrate, such as environmental exposure to lead, stressful household situations and in most extreme case, response to abuse.
Severe marital stress or financial stress in the household can affect the child, and other psychiatric problems can overlap or mimic ADHD, such as severe anxiety.
``One of the key questions in the evaluation is has the child always had difficulty sitting still, sustaining attention to a task, or is this something new,'' said Gold, who added that often behavioral and other educational help is tried first before approaching medication.
Examining 10- and 11-year-olds in Oxfordshire and in western Massachusetts, Jacobson found that there was little difference between the behavior of children in whom the disorder is diagnosed and those found to be normal.
Both groups surpassed the average for inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not listening and fidgeting.

Stimulant medications can then seem as progressive as insulin or penicillin.
