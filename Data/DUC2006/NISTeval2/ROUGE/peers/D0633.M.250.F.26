The bad news comes at a time when Chicago is witnessing a drop in murders.
"Three strikes" is not the only thing special in California.
The system is known in government circles as "crime prevention through environmental design." In 1999, 42,895 households and 77,750 people age 12 or older were interviewed for the survey.
The last year murders numbered less than 700 was 1988, when there were 663.
There were 629 there last year, compared with a 1990 high of 2,262.
In contrast, there were 3 million in 1995, a rate of 13.8.
Currently, there are 40 million children under the age of 10 nationwide.
In that same period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.
The 1996 violent crime rate against victims was down 16 percent from 1993.
But Fox cautioned: "People should remember that these numbers aren't the full story." Other background: http://www.ncpa.org/pi/crime/crime.html Handguns were the type of firearms most often reported used in the killings.
Eleven officers were killed in the Midwest and seven in the Northeast.
In 1997, the South was by far the most dangerous region for law enforcement officers.
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's homicide totals for the first time ever.
