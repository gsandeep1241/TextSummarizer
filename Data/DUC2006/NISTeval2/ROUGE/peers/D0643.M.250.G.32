Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _.
Although La Nina is already affecting rainfall in Southeast Asia, it hasn't noticeably influenced North America's weather yet, Leetmaa said Instead, it may be that warm water left over from El Nino is
