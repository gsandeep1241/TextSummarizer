The talks signaled the continuation of the peace process following Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron last month.
Israeli government's move to create the civilian guards forces also came amid reports that Israel and the Palestinian National Authority are close to reaching an agreement on Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
official Sunday expressed Washington's deep concern over the ongoing Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, saying it will hamper the peace making between Israel and the Palestinians.
The international community was surprised over Israel's construction work at the Abu Ghneim Mountain and Ras al-Amoud settlements and the expansion of the Maali Adumim settlement, al-Masri said.
