Both clubs have been pondering how to compete against online booksellers in a book market radically changed from the days when judges made Book-of-the- Club selections over sherry that had the power to spread literary culture to readers isolated far from bookstores.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions.
The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes Noble -- the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co., the world's largest book distributor.
In the case of the Book-of-the--Club, they've really been struggling over the last couple of years, so this is an opportunity to put some operational systems together.
But with the rise of online bookselling and instant purchases at the click of a computer mouse, book clubs in the late 1990s were forced to offer something more than discounts.
For the independent booksellers, the worst fears are that a new book conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes Noble could ultimately affect issues like credit, speed of delivery and access to popular titles that are in short supply.
It will draw upon the strength of bookseller numbers and process orders from customers.
And those numbers do not include sales figures from thriving fundamentalist Christian publishers.
The City Council in Berkeley, Calif., passed a resolution supporting the effort of independent booksellers to block the merger.
