LHASA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Work on a solar-energy power station was completed today and it started generating electricity for a primary school in a suburb of the Tibetan regional capital of Lhasa.
A Japanese new energy research and development institute helped the power station as part of solar energy cooperative project between China and Japan to help China's less-developed areas.
Tibet has plenty of solar energy resources and Japan has a great deal of experience in the use of solar energy, according to a local official, who says that China and Japan will continue to cooperate in building power projects in Tibet.
AMERSFOORT, Netherlands (AP) _ It's another typically cloudy Dutch day, but Rien van Stigt can still hear the soft hum of his solar-powered boiler heating up water for dishes and the shower.
The overcast Netherlands seems an unlikely hot spot for solar energy.
With solar collectors and panels sprouting from rooftops and roadsides across the Netherlands, some say solar power could one day overshadow wind turbines, the modern cousins of the storied Dutch windmills.
``Holland is a very busy country with a lot of people and little space,'' says Stefan Wink at Novem, a Dutch environmental agency.
Nearly 60 percent of the Netherlands' electricity is produced by burning natural gas, followed by coal, 28 percent; nuclear, 5 percent; oil, 4.6 percent; burning waste products, 2.4 percent; and wind, 0.5 percent.
