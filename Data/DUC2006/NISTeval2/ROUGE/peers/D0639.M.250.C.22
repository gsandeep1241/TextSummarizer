SUDAN planned to make deadly nerve agent, U.S. says.
Although the administration says the precursor has no other use than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical weapons, said another administration official, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
The evidence the administration has cited as justification for the attack consisted of a soil sample secretly obtained months ago outside the pharmaceutical factory, the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, the officials said.
In hitting Sudanese installations, the administration wanted to warn Sudan that it knew about the chemical weapon preparations and that it should stop helping Iraq, the diplomat said.
The administration says the soil samples contain Empta, a chemical not found in nature and with no known uses outside the manufacture of the deadly nerve gas VX.
A spokesman would not say Friday whether the intelligence agency told Clinton that the plant made medicine, or whether the agency deemed that fact important.
Iraq rejected as a fabrication Tuesday the contention by U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
``But in the short term, it is certainly an effective tactic''.
Idris said he has always opposed terrorism as a tool of political action, has never met with bin Laden and has not knowingly done business with him or any of his associates.
He said Empta, used to make chemical weapons, was found outside the al-Shifa facility.
