The coho salmon to be affected by the Headwaters habitat plan now amount to just 1 percent of their original numbers.
Those jobs disappeared after logging and mining destroyed the coho salmon's habitat.
The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act.
In turn, the Canadians cut back ocean fishing off Vancouver Island for Puget Sound-bound chinook and coho salmon.
