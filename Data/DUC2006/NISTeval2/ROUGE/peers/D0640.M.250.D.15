Collision with a heavy object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision.
The multipurpose submarine went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on Sunday while attending a routine exercise of the Russian Northern Fleet.
Kursk was participating in exercises of the Russian Northern Fleet when disaster struck, reportedly on Saturday.
Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts to dock with the Kursk overnight.
Two American submarines were in the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included the Kursk.
The Kursk was shattered by an explosion and sank in the Barents Sea during exercises Aug. 12.

Russian officials are focusing on indications that the Kursk collided with an underwater object, possibly a foreign submarine.
