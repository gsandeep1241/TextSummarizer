Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs which entered China from overseas.
Of all the gang's crimes, the most astonishing one was undoubtedly the kidnapping of Victor Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's most powerful businessman, in May 1996.
But the Hong Kong Standard reported Friday that Cheung was trying to pin the blame for masterminding the kidnapping of one businessman, identified only by the surname ``Li,'' on one of Cheung's purported henchmen, Chan Chi-ho.
The Chinese death penalty handed down to a reputed Hong Kong crime boss violates terms of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, according to a lawyer who said Friday he will seek international help to spare his client's life.
