According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
Many Olympic athletes try to foil the tests by using masking agents or a new batch of difficult-to-trace water-based steroids.
Renney, a crew chief of the U.S. Olympic drug-testing committee, said, ``There's no masking agent that will keep steroids from being detected.
Anabolic steroids, which made their first impact on athletic competition with the world-record weightlifting performances by the 1956 Russian Olympic team, are still in prominent use despite the health hazards they pose.
All five defendants denied, however, that they knowingly damaged the health of the athletes, some of whom were as young as 12 when they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills.
Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta Games, while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned strength-builders.
Prosecutors say the 20 female athletes involved in the case suffered serious side-effects from the drugs, and that Ewald and Hoeppner knew of the potential danger.
With a colleague, Dr. Diane Elliot, Goldberg recently completed a program for 3,200 athletes in 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington among whom steroid use was reduced by a reported 50 percent.
The number of male students that reported having used steroids within a year was cut by 50 percent.
