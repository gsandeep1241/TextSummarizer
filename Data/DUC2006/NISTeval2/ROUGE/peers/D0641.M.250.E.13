Conditions like El Nino might settle in if global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as droughts or excessive winter rain a computer study suggests.
These effects open up a new way of tracking the progress of global warming without the uncertainties in simple temperature measurements.
Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might have a similar effect.
Computer models of the effects of warming point to the appearance of jets of fast-moving wind between the troposphere and stratosphere, roughly 12 kilometers above the Earth's surface.
Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study suggests.
The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
Chinese scientists believe that global warming, particularly higher winter temperatures, will continue.
In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark report that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.
For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
While the study does not prove that human-induced global warming is what caused the change in frequency of circulation patterns, the change is consistent with it.
