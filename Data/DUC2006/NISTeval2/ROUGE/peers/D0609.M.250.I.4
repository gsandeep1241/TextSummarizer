The Palestinian Authority (PA) has accused the Israeli settlement policy of aiming to prevent the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and isolating Jerusalem from the West Bank through building new Jewish settlements.
Muasher's remarks coincided with an Israeli government decision Friday to give tax breaks and generous grants to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a move that could entice more Israelis to settle in the occupied area.
Since its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast War, Israel has created over 190 Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories, of which 173 are scattered across the West Bank.
Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5, 892 units under construction.
Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up an attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Palestinians, who regards Jewish settlements as violation of signed agreements, have been angered by the Israeli cabinet's approval of the construction of 2, 600 new housing units in four West Bank settlements this week.
