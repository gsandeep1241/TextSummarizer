In compliance with the convention, Uganda has made efforts to raise awareness of the public about uses of wetlands and the need of conservation.
"History has told us that the protection of wetlands represents the protection of ourselves, for the destruction of wetlands means the destruction of man's living environment," the minister said.
Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's "kidney" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land.
The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms.
The agency is responsible for issuing permits for filling in small tracts of wetlands and thus can limit development.
Before a city creates 800 acres of wetlandsit needs to know whether the concept works.
He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones.
In addition to any fine, Vail Resorts will have to pay to fix the damage to the wetlands.
Environmentalists say more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year, about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national permit system.
They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers.
Under the Clean Water Act, the corps has jurisdiction over any project that involves the discharge of fill or dredged material into waterways, which include rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands.
