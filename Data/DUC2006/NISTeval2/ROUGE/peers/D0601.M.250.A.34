WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian reservations would get an infusion of $1.2 billion in federal money for education, health care and law enforcement under President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, a White House aide said.
Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on Indian issues, said it's the largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded programs in nearly all federal agencies.
``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, one day after she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.
Among the spending Clinton will seek: $300 million to build at least six new reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main agency funding tribal governments, said the extra money is welcome but won't address all the problems.
