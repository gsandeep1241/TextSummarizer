Despite months of labor peace since last summer's devastating strikes, United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich said that we still have our problems with General Motors Corp. and hinted at another showdown national contract talks begin.
The strikes at two parts plants in Flint brought the world's largest automaker to a virtual halt in North America.
The health of the U.S. auto industry and the costly lessons learned from devastating UAW strikes against GM decrease the chance for a walkout some industry analysts say.
Crippling strikes at General Motors parts factories have left the United Automobile Workers union and GM fighting over whether the auto maker is pursuing an America Last strategy, but the reality lies somewhere in between their positions.
National labor talks between Detroit's automakers and the United Auto Workers began against a background of record sales that have left General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash.
The tentative agreements reached GM and its former parts division Delphi Automotive Systems provide 185,000 workers with 3 percent pay raises each year for four years and a signing bonus of $1,350.
The UAW typically expects all three automakers to accept the same terms.
Far fewer UAW workers would be needed to assemble each car, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.
GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing the new assembly plants and the union response in these meetings has been mixed, UAW officials said in recent interviews.
