NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io feared the probe might not survive.
Jupiter's other major moons are Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.
Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system _ has earthlike aspects.
The current two-year mission extension is focusing on the moon.
If such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the planet with extraterrestrial life.

The probe made the closest-ever flyby at 10:06 p.m. PDT Sunday, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
New photos from the Galileo satellite show lava.
Funding and other details have not yet been worked out, he said.
Because of increasing interest in Europa's watery past or present, NASA is making plans for a spacecraft to be launched in 2003 and go into an orbit of the Jovian moon in 2008.
Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by robotic space probes, scientists said at an all-day seminar on the latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter.
The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe has shown.
