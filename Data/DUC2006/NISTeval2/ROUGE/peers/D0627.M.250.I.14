In the last few years, the media have focused on global dramas highlighting the plight of children needing homes: Chinese girls abandoned in markets by parents encumbered by the country's one-child policy and its preference for boys; Romanian children orphaned by revolution or left in understaffed institutions by their impoverished parents; Russian children stranded in dismal state orphanages, in a society that widely stigmatizes adoption.
Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
Most of the long-established agencies involved in international adoptions have ``an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every child deserves a family,'' Ms. Harder said.
Two lawmakers in Washington, rejecting the advice of adoption professionals across the ideological spectrum, threaten to prevent US approval of a landmark international treaty intended to improve the treatment of children, streamline adoption practices worldwide, and curtail corruption in the process.
At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents.
The existing law on adoption placed excessive restrictions on people who are fully capable and willing to adopt children, and prolonged overcrowding in government institutions for orphans and handicapped minors, according to Doje.
In a report submitted to the 4th meeting of the 9th NPC Standing Committee last Monday, Doje Cering, minister of civil affairs, said that the draft has stricter requirements on adoption of Chinese children by foreigners, but Wan pointed out today that "requirements" means adoption procedures.
