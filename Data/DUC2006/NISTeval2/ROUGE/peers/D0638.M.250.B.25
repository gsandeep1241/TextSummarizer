Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
A report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the planet with extraterrestrial life.
`` But we are talking about very simple organisms that can live on these energy sources, '' said Eric Gaidos, the paper 's lead author and a geobiologist at Caltech.
'' Because of increasing interest in Europa 's watery past or present, NASA is making plans for a spacecraft to be launched in 2003 and go into an orbit of the Jovian moon in 2008.
These winds are driven by heat escaping from the planet 's core.
Within five years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
In coming years, scientists and engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hope to launch a robotic probe to the Jovian moon Europa.
This new information of Io may be related to the intense heating of the moon caused by the constant squeezing and distortion of Io in the Jupiter
