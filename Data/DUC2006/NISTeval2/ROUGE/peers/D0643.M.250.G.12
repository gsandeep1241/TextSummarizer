The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world weather months in advance.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart El Nino a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
The change in the weather was the work of El Nino.
La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
Just two weeks ago National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina -- a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
If we can predict a change in the weather such as when El Nino cycles around we could have all the interventions in place before the weather changes.
La Nina caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific alternates with the warming El Nino.
Weak La Nina conditions have started to develop the World Meteorological in its El Nino/La Nina Update.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects wind and temperature patterns.
Mike Edwards spokesman for the bureau said the disturbed weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on South African weather and that earlier forecasts for dry
