STATION, R.I.
_ A submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday, bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
Investigators, zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing the two flight recorders, eventually found that maintenance workers had covered the 757's static ports with protective masking tape when they washed the plane, and had neglected to remove it _ an oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from the instruments and flew the plane to its doom.
In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia last year, the recorders have provided no insight into the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air traffic controllers on the ground.
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who are treating all debris recovered from the aircraft as potential criminal evidence even though the investigation has turned up no indication that the plane was brought down by a crime or terrorism, accompanied the recorder on its trip.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing all 217 people on board.
