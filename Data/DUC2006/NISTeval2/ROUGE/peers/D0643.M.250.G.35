There was good news Wednesday from the world's weather forecasters: the massive disruptions caused by El Nino are coming to an end.
By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the International dateline, WMO said.
The El-Nino-like temperature pattern might be broken every five years or so by a strong cooling like the periodic phenomenon called La Nina, he added.
Overall the El Nino weather phenomenon of 1997-98 produced more benefits than destruction for the United States, according to a new analysis by climatologist Stanley A. Changnon.
And its $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion in damage is far outweighed by nearly $20 billion in benefits, Changnon reports in the September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
If La Nina dissipates before it hits Los Angeles, the area could face a more typical wet winter.
Normally the short rainy season ends in December, but this year was different.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature patterns.
The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events.
