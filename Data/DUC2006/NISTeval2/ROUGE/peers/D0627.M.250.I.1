Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950s led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24.
She was 96.
Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.
In 1954, Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in Korean orphanages.
``We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Holt later wrote in ``The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption.
``We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care''.
At first, the Holts sent money to Korean orphanages, but soon decided that the children needed families.
They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children.
Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.
At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children.
But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2.
