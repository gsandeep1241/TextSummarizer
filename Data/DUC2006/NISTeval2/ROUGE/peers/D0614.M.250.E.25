Barring a surprise in the campaign 's final week, separatist Premier Lucien Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois are expected to win another term in provincial elections Nov 30 and begin laying the groundwork for Quebec 's third referendum on leaving Canada.
MONTREAL _ With popular support for Quebec 's independence in remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada made a bold gamble with his country 's future last week, introducing legislation that lays out Canada 's first road map for national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will never follow it.
Surveys released last week show that Quebecers believe Bouchard is honest, dedicated, hard-working, and, perhaps above all, the one politician capable of forcing Canada to show respect for its most willful and wayward province.
The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from the country.
In the final results of Monday 's election, his separatist Parti Quebecois won 75 seats, two fewer than in 1994, while the Liberal Party, which favors keeping Quebec in Canada, won 48, an increase of one.
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he promises another referendum in the next election because " people in Quebec don't want any referendum, " Chretien said.
