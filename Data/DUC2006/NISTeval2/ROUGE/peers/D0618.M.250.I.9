Africa is optimistic in its endeavors to eradicate malaria which has affected the social and economic development of the continent, health experts meeting in Harare said.
As Ruebush said, ``Malaria is eminently curable if it is caught early and treated appropriately.
Kemal said that the malaria prevention activities are being undertaken in a series of campaigns because of the occurence of the epidemic in the area in a larger scale than that of last year.
Malaria spread in 14 central and central highland provinces of Vietnam in the first seven months this year, Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
A further boost to their initiatives was through the commitment of African leaders to combat the disease as evidenced by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Harare Declaration on Malaria Prevention and Control signed in June 1997 in Zimbabwe's capital city.
At the same time, the assembly requests the World Health Organization (WHO) to continue working closely with the OAU to coordinate efforts aimed at the eradication of malaria from the African continent and to increase its level of support in that respect.
The Yunnan Institute of Malaria Prevention, China's only malaria research organ of its kind, established in 1957, has been running classes in the past 40 years and has trained more than 2,000 personnel in malaria prevention and treatment.
The program, called African Initiative for Malaria Control in the 21st century (AIM), will be launched next year and will cover all the 46 countries in Africa.
