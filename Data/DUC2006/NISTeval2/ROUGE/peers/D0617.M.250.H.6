WASHINGTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir pilot seeking asylum in England who says he has information about October's deadly crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 will be interviewed by U.S. accident investigators.
Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing all 217 people on board.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
``There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
"We do not know at this point what caused the crash," Hall said at a press conference.
WASHINGTON _ Investigators, aided by several Arabic interpreters, pored over the cockpit voice recorder of EgyptAir Flight 990 Monday to try to determine whether a criminal act caused the plane to crash two weeks ago killing all 217 people on board.
