The Macpherson report denounced the Metropolitan Police as fundamentally racist for its handling of the investigation into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, stabbed to death by white youths in 1993.
Three of the suspects were acquitted in 1996 in a widely faulted prosecution and cannot be tried again despite the subsequent emergence of a video tape in which they assailed blacks and demonstrated knifing techniques that bore chilling resemblances to the way Lawrence was killed.
After the Macpherson report, the government promised to broaden anti-discrimination laws and make immediate changes in policing methods.
Police forces in England and Wales were failing to eradicate racial prejudice in their ranks, a government inspector's report said on Monday.
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted "institutional racism" in London's Metropolitan Police following the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
"There are pockets of good practise, but generally there is room for substantial improvement," said Dan Crompton, the report's author, who investigated how forces have implemented 20 recommendations made by the inspectorate 16 months ago.
The inquiry into the Lawrence case and racism among the police ended in November after 69 days of hearings over an eight-month period and has taken on dramatic new life this year through a play based entirely on testimony called ``The Color of Justice'' that is playing to sellout audiences in a small West London theater and is moving to the West End in May.
