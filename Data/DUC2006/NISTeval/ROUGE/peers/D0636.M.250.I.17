National labor talks between Detroit ' s automakers and the United Auto Workers began today against a background of record sales that have left General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash . The future of workers at GM ' s former parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems Corp ., also is a key issue in these negotiations . When leaders of General Motors Corp . and the United Auto Workers met Wednesday to start the long process of negotiating a new national contract, there was no sign of the acrimony that has long marked their relations . General Motors Corp . and the United Auto Workers appear to have patched up their relationship with a lucrative four-year contract --- but at steep price for GM, industry experts said . All in all, contract negotiations between the union and General Motors Corp ., Ford Motor CCo., and DaimlerChrysler AG were quick and peaceful . The UAW ' s deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a separate company . `` The people who currently work for the automakers are all winners, '' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State University ' s School of Labor and Industrial Relations .
