The National Academy of Sciences published a book this year reiterating its 15-year-old position that the theory of evolution _ and not religious beliefs _ should be taught in every public school biology classroom.
``The evolution-creation controversy is as charged today as it was when Scopes was tried,'' said Randy Moore, a professor of biology at Louisville University in Kentucky and the editor of The American Biology Teacher, a magazine published by the National Association of Biology Teachers.
While the often emotional debate between proponents of creationism and evolution is not new, it was rekindled this summer when the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete almost any mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum.
But Charles Darwin 's theory still faces challenges in the nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists, state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject evolution.
Over time, Darwin 's ideas have prevailed.
So the new battles in Kansas and elsewhere pit theory against theory _ intelligent design versus Darwin.
And the debate rages a decade after the Supreme Court ruled that public schools can't teach that God created the universe.
But belief does not usually, elsewhere, lead to opposing the teaching of evolution.
Dick Teresi, a science writer and co-leader of the God and Science Project, says that the fanaticism of creationists has made scientists so defensive that they have lost the critical perspective that is the basis of
