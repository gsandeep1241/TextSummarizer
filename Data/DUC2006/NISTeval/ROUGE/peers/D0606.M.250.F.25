'' This compilation of research results make it undeniable that a major warming is affecting the Arctic environment, '' said Michael T Ledbetter of the National Science Foundation in Washington, which funded the study, co-authored by 11 climatologists from five universities in the United States.
Researchers on the US Assessment team, while giving weight to such arguments, say they miss the larger point : With global climate shifting, risk is rising.
WASHINGTON ( AP Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
Changes in rain and snowfall patterns could affect the availability of fresh water, and crop productivity is likely to rise nationally due to the fertilizing effect of more carbon dioxide in the air, although regional cropping patterns may change significantly.
Climate changes affecting the planet are caused mainly by the burning of coal, oil and gas.
Last year, scientists declared 1997 the warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature.
