South African Environment Minister Valli Moosa said on Friday that global warming resulted in the rise in incidence of malaria.
The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global warming on the United States over the next 100 years.
