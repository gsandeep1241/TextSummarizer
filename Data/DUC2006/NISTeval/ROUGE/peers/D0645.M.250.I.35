Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, landlords agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who then pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their children and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the social problems that afflict families under such stress, said Helen Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Republicans have long wanted to give low-income working people a greater share of subsidized housing, while Democrats wanted to favor the poorest of the poor, who have no resources to obtain shelter at market rates.
In New York City, 40 percent of project residents would have to have incomes at or below $15,000, but other residents would be able to make up to $40,150.
In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of government subsides.
A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in Massachusetts.
