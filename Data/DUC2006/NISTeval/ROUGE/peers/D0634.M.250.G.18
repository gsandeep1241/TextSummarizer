The agreement represents a victory for all those on both sides of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term viability of their salmon industries, said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Alberight in a joint statement issued here Thursday.
The comprehensive agreement, reached through vigorous diplomacy among the responsible parties, is designed to ensure the sustentation of the five Pacific salmon species through a combination of scientific co-operation, in addition to providing new funds to improve fisheries management and aid recovery of weakened salmon stocks.
The agreement is also necessary to limit on salmon catches, said the joint statement.
The talks to end the four-year deadlock in the Pacific Salmon Treaty involve reducing the high levels of U.S. interception of salmon heading through Alaskan waters in Canadian waters to breed, and a balanced reduction in Canadian and American interception each other's salmon stocks farther south off Vancouver Island, in the Fraser River and Straits of Juan de Fuca.
The report also comes at a time when residents of the Northwest and the country are already spending millions of dollars and facing potential restrictions in development in order to address other factors thought to be harming Pacific salmon, such as overfishing, dams and hatcheries.
``That was already true, or becoming true, in Portland, but clearly with major listings in the Puget Sound, salmon have come to the city.''
