Nabarro, who has worked in Iraq and Nepal as well as Africa, and taught international community health at the Liverpool School of Medicine, explained that the project did not have a single goal, like some public health campaigns.
``The Vietnamese war actually made the U.S. Army invest big in malaria drug development, and so some pharmaceutical companies took up leads from that effort,'' he said.
At the same time the parasites that cause malaria and the mosquitoes that carry them have alarmed public health officials with their fast-evolving resistance to most known medicines and insecticides.
The leaders of the cooperating agencies said Friday that the anti-malaria drive will include efforts to generate new research in the pharmaceutical industry and to raise money from reluctant governments, as well as local efforts to provide health centers with insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets for village beds and packets of fast-acting pills or suppositories for malaria sufferers.
The budget for the first year has been estimated at about $19 million for the organizations involved, with additional money being sought from governments where the disease is rampant and the labor force is weakened or reduced as a result.
Complicating matters, preventive measures have gotten trickier and much more costly in recent years, ever since the malaria parasite in most areas developed resistance to chloroquine, the inexpensive and well-tolerated medication that had long been used to prevent and treat malaria.
Current options cost a lot more and are associated with potentially more serious side effects.
