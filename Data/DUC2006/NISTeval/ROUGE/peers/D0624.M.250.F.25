The Guardian : The five men suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence could face perjury charges after their two days of evidence ended Tuesday with them fleeing from the inquiry building under a hail of missiles from an angry crowd.
Ian Johnston, assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner for southeast London, told Neville and Doreen Lawrence that he `` could not justify '' errors in the investigation into the stabbing and death of Stephen Lawrence, 18, at a London bus stop on April 22 1993.
The government, which has received praise from backers of the Lawrence family for its pursuit of the case, came in for criticism on Monday for actions it took this weekend to prevent publication of a leaked version of the report, which is due to be made public on Wednesday.
`` I deeply regret that we have not brought Stephen 's racist murderers to justice and I would like to personally apologize again today to Mr and Mrs Lawrence for our failures, '' Condon said, from his seat a few feet away from Neville and Doreen Lawrence at a public inquiry into the case.
'' The report, commissioned after police botched the investigation into the 1993 racially motivated murder of a black teenager, Stephen Lawrence, has put pressure on Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police chief, to resign.
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week.
