``It's time for the automobile manufacturers to put kids first in the design of their vehicles, and to focus on the back seat where kids sit most of the time,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
``Unfortunately, in the past kids have been just an afterthought in terms of the design of safety features for an automobile,'' he said.
``Safety advocates know that children should be in child restraints up to the age of 4, in booster seats to the age of 8, and in the back seat,'' said Hall -- speaking in a state where 2-year-olds can be legally restrained by nothing other than a seat belt.
Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop.
Some researchers view the black box as a way to improve automobile safety.
The board has placed the devices on its new ``most-wanted list'' of safety improvements.
Technology that allows for its implementation is new.
``There is more personal information available on the Internet than what will be collected by these devices''.
There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side air bags.
Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds
