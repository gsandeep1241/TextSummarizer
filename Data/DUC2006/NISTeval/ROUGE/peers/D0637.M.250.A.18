Yunnan Province in subtropical southwest China has become a leader of the country in the utilization of solar energy.
The province has made marked progress in developing solar water heater, solar furnace, solar battery and basic theoretical research on the solar energy.
The use of solar energy saves the province more than 100 million kwh of electricity each year, local officials said.
Professor Xia Laifeng from Yunnan Teachers 'University, the solar energy research base in the province, said that they are studying the possibility of building ``solar energy houses,'' which use solar energy for heating and air conditioning, and are decorated with solar energy equipment.
These projects are divided into five categories, namely, the rural electrification program, the global education and training program, the water desalination and purification program, the information and communication program, as well as the industrial policy, market penetration and technology transfer program.
The program says the World Solar Commission, which drew up the program, will accomplish these projects through mobilizing a concerted global effort with the continued cooperation and commitment of various governments, international organizations, bilateral and multilateral funding institutions, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, research organizations and universities.
The first group of proposals includes forming a Sino-Israeli center to expand the use of solar energy in the region, and developing an energy-efficient solar water heater, which would be especially suited to sunny north China.
