At a time when China's economy is slowing and social unrest is rising, officials here view this amorphous but fast-growing sect as a dangerous political force.
Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China was continuing to be a military threat to Taiwan, the human rights document led Congress on Friday to raise new questions about the effectiveness of the administration's policies of engagement with China.
"I think it's a mistake to conclude that the human rights in China is entirely a function of what U.S. policy is," Koh said.
Clinton administration officials, scholars and leaders of human rights groups all agree that underlying the Chinese government's fears about social unrest is the downturn in the country's economy.
Last year's rather mild description of China's human rights policies provoked criticism that the administration was overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the issue as an obstacle to trade.
In a speech in San Francisco on Friday, President Clinton defended his administration 's policy of engagement with China and China was " moving away from the rule of fear, ' it was " not yet S1ed in the rule of law. " "They haven't had the growth they need to continue with their economic reforms," said a senior administration official involved in China policy.
Moreover, in the coming months a series of anniversaries in China could spark unrest that might further test the leadership's tolerance of dissent .
