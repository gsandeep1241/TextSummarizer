Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might have a similar effect.
Could this be related to global warming?
Computer models have indicated that global warming in the lower atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
Environmentalists, too, are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall global warming.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
``Global warming won't be a simple warming of the Earth. ''The data suggest that global warming has caused a slowdown of the Earth at a rate of 0.56 milliseconds a century''.
Scientists have become more and more concerned about the possible health consequences of global warming.
Nevertheless, it is important to explode the myth that most scientists are worried about global warming.
At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global warming to changes in circulation patterns.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global warming.
McKelvey said the team's ultimate aim was to show the likely effect of future global warming.
Valli Moosa said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
"Global warming is happening all the time," McKelvey told the Australian Associated Press in Sydney .
