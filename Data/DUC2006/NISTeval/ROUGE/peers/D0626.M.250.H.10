Twin bombings at U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and the Kenyan capital killed 257 people.
A suspect in the recent bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was arrested by Pakistani authorities and handed over to Kenya.
American authorities allege the attacks were plotted by Saudi terrorist.
One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper to have informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year of planned terrorist attacks against them.
"No matter what it takes, we must find those responsible for these evil acts and see that justice is done," Clinton said at the ceremony marking the return of remains of Americans who were killed in the Kenya embassy bombing.
In an almost simultaneous blast Aug. 7, another bomb killed 11 people, all Africans, at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania.
Tanzania expelled five Iraqis and a Libyan who were questioned by the FBI and police in connection of the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last month, a newspaper reported Friday.
This year he renewed his vow to wage a holy war against the United States, and senior officials have said he has a network in Africa, with U.S. intelligence finding evidence that he has operatives in Kenya.
Investigators believe Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and more than 70 in the Tanzanian commercial capital Dar
