Early diagnosis has long been a goal of autism researchers, who theorize that the condition results from brain abnormalities that develop before birth.
One recent study, for example, found that the autistic children who had antibodies to the measles virus in their blood also had higher levels of antibodies to their own brain tissue, particularly to a protein found in myelin, the substance that forms the protective sheath around nerve fibers.
And for families, everything is secondary to getting results for their children.
But this study suggests that the defects may be present much earlier and it certainly ``stimulates new ideas about the cause of these disorders,'' Eric Courchesne said.
But there is no evidence that VIP-like substances from the intestines can ever get into the brain, Eric Courchesne said.
The locations of the damage help explain some of the symptoms of autism.
But in scientific studies, secretin so far has proved no better than a dummy injection.
``A single dose of synthetic human secretin is not an effective treatment for autism or pervasive developmental disorder,'' the study concluded.
Repligen Corp. said Wednesday that secretin, its drug to treat autism, does not appear to work after a single injection, although company officials predicted that more positive results will appear with higher doses.
The state, meanwhile, reimburses school districts on a sliding scale, depending on the severity of the disability, but never more than $11,000 per child.
The cells are also immature, with stunted connections.
