Information from the plane's flight data recorder, one of the two black boxes, should tell investigators if a thruster deployed in flight, he said.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) said last week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing all 217 people on board.
There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have, Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
Cruising at 33,000 feet, EgyptAir Flight 990 was uneventful until the plane's autopilot disconnected about 8 seconds before the jetliner, with 217 people aboard, began to drop down toward the Atlantic Ocean, crash investigators said Wednesday.
Asked about Hall's statement, the official said Friday night that he stood by his original account.
Two other officials said the working theory remains the plane was sent into a dive shortly after takeoff from New York's Kennedy Airport.
Egyptian and U.S. investigators were seeking to know exactly what happened to the EgyptAir plane, Rayan said.
As painstaking a process as it is to read out cockpit voice recorders, this one is made more difficult, Hall said.
CAIRO, August 13 ( Xinhua ) Egyptian Pilots Association chief Walid Murad demanded on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash interview pilots who said they saw a shooting fireball
