Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon.
Clinton is proposing $290 million for salmon conservation programs in the West and Pacific Northwest.
Canada and the United States announced that they have reached an agreement on the elements of a ten-year accord to conserve and manage Pacific salmon.
The agreement represents a victory for all those on both sides of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term viability of their salmon industries.
Will the elaborate, two-decade-old system for moving fish around the dams prove inadequate to save the salmon?
By the end of the day virtually every watershed in Washington state will be subject to the strictures of the federal Endangered Species Act, which makes it a crime to harm endangered and threatened species.
The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among salmon.
There is no guarantee that the plan would work, and it would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the Pacific Northwest's electricity.
The dams were also constructed to turn Lewiston, Idaho, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean, into the West's most inland seaport.
