The Mongolian Ministry of External Relations should be active in promoting economic diplomacy, its new minister R. Amarjargal said in the People's Right newspaper published on Friday.
In his first speech published after he took office late last month, Amarjargal said it is the call of the times to add economic diplomacy to the work of the ministry, for the economic relations between Mongolia and other countries bear a special significance for Mongolia's further development.
On the fundamental principle of Mongolia's foreign policy, the 37-year-old minister said his country should be active in political and economic activities in the northeast Asia and the whole Asian-Pacific region.
During the talks, Obuchi said that Japan, which is the largest donor nation for Mongolia, will support the inland country's democratic and economic reform, the expansion of bilateral trade, the increase of investment in Mongolia and the development of small- and medium-size enterprises.
The two leaders also exchanged views on the situation in the Korean Peninsula and in the Northeast Asian region.
One important part of Mongolia's foreign policy, he said, is to strength friendly relations and cooperation with China, which is not only in the interests of the two countries, but also favorable for peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region.
China has always understood the importance of developing a long-term, stable, and good-neighborly friendship with Mongolia, and any changes in Mongolia's political system and government will not affect China's consistent and friendly policies toward the country.
