Moscow, (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there.
The Russian military is trying to prevent incursions of Islamic militants from Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan.
`We have no border with Chechnya _ that is the Russian Federation and troop movements can take place there whenever necessary,'' Putin said.
78,000 refugees have fled to Ingushetia, a tiny and impoverished Russian region west of Chechnya.
The Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population were living.
Only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks.
It said 60 rebels, among them people speaking Russian, have formed a unit to carry out terrorist acts in Russia.
