David Rocchio, deputy legal counsel to Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who has been involved in discussions on Indian gambling through the National Governors' Association, said that ``the concern that governors have is not with the benefit casinos bring to tribes.''Rather, Rocchio said, ``the concern is with the carve-out from state regulation, such as land use, police power and other ancillary concerns that arise when tribes have casinos_and the impact on the residents not only on the tribal lands but also on other lands in the state.''Like gambling venues everywhere, casinos attract crime, and can prey on compulsive gamblers.
In February 1996, the Santee Sioux opened the Ohiya Casino on reservation land, in a metal building not much bigger than a 7-Eleven store.
Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve.
The effort reflects the Indians' increasing ability to assert itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos.
But it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.
Some reservation schools have done well and others, including the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago.
