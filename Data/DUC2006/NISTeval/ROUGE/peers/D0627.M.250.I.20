There are many reasons that American families turn to international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle foster care.
Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call the ``Ovarian Olympics.
The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same everywhere.
Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
At many agencies, race determines fees, said William Pierce, president of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group for agencies.
Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle independent adoptions: ``Now everybody thinks adoption is easy money, especially the attorneys,'' Ms. Chalker said.
For the old-line agencies, ``there are Catch-22's everywhere,'' said Pierce of the National Council for Adoption.
In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different: it is for parents.
While the focus of the meeting was commonality, and the mood was decidedly upbeat and optimistic, there was no effort to gloss over the problems of either adoption or race.
The treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions, is considered by adoption professionals and politicians active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted to reform adoption, streamline the process, and weed out corruption worldwide.
International adoptions are nothing like what Masters experienced.
Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.
At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions.
