The book_first printed in 1989 by Haughton Publishing of Dallas and since sold to public schools in more than a dozen states, including Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Texas_suggests that intelligent design, as engineered by an intelligent agent, may be a more compelling explanation than biological evolution for the wide variety found in nature.
While the book stops well short of identifying God as the designer, as creationists might, critics, including those affiliated with the National Association of Biology Teachers, have condemned the book as little more than an artfully worded end-run around the constitutional separation of church and state in the classroom.
But to Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of Wildlife and Parks who presented the book to the Pratt board, ``Of Pandas and People'' and its theory of intelligent design provides the perfect antidote to those teachers who might be tempted to teach evolution as an undisputed fact.
``I see the theory as saying, `It is legitimate to have, as part of the tool kit for science education, the option to say that the things we see in nature may be designed or could have been designed,''' he said.
Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who has written four books attacking ``the dogmatic teaching of Darwinian evolution'' advocates that students be taught to be distrustful of the evolution theory.
