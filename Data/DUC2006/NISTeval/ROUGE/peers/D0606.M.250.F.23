The World Wide Fund for Nature on October 17th, 1996 called for stronger actions to combat the threat of climate change to wildlife and natural ecosystems.
Michael Oppenheimer made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing major coastal flooding worldwide.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
The answer depends on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that is already resulting from global warming.
Long-term climate change such as global warming could have major impacts on human health, the environment, the economy and society, said Dr. James Baker.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
Global warming resulted in the rise in incidence of malaria.
The Arctic town of Sachs Harbour in Canada on the west coast of Banks Island is slowly sinking into the sea as a result of global warming.
Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
