The arrival of online booksellers has failed far to expand the market for popular, according to the Book Industry Study Group.
On June 6, the booksellers association will begin to unveil Booksense.com, a site turning the independents into "local store dot-com, closed but open 24 hours a day," says Michael Hoynes, the program's marketing officer.
After through a drought in the mid-1990s the publishing industry posted gains of more than 4 percent last year and is poised for more modest increases despite the rapid emergence of online booksellers.
online stores captured 2 percent of the book market independent booksellers continued to lose share.
The booksellers association is also creating its own on-line selling site, BookSense.com, scheduled to be ready by late summer.
Booksense.com, which has been delayed since the fall by technical problems, grows out of Booksense, a "national marketing umbrella" launched by the booksellers association for its beleaguered members in February 1999.
That conclusion may defy the conventional wisdom of some of the top publishers who gathered in Southern California Sunday at the Los Angeles Convention Center for Book Expo America, the annual and sometimes uneasy business reunion of independent booksellers and their suppliers.
Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to appeal to independent booksellers.
With the widespread availability of books and the plethora of titles on the market, booksellers struggled to understand why they were not reaching more readers.
