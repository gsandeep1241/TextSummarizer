Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
Residents of about 22 percent of the state's rental housing stock receive some form of state or federal subsidy.
Lazio voted against capping rent for public housing tenants based on their incomes.
`As we focus on addressing the homelessness problem, we shouldn't be pushing more low-income families out of public housing.''.
The vouchers allow low-income families to find their own housing, and to use government subsidies to help pay the costs.
The agency owns more than 1,200 units of low- and moderate-income housing and offers rent subsidies in 1,900 additional units.
In Massachusetts, there are about 130,000 low-income families living in subsidized housing under a variety of programs, with as many as 100,000 families on waiting lists for affordable housing units.
It requires that at least 40 percent of a housing authority's newly available units go to families earning less than 30 percent of a region's median income.
Another idea is ceiling rents, where tenants pay the market value of the apartment rather than 30 percent of their income.
About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.
HUD says people should not spend more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing.
