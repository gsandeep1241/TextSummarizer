A full report on the group's new findings is being published Thursday in the scientific journal Nature.
If so, it would be the first planetary moon known to have one.
Io's orbit lies in an area of intense radiation from Jupiter's radiation belts.
Only in or near the volcano vents is the moon's surface warm.
More than 30 volcanoes have been discovered on the small moon.
Galileo was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989.
The Galileo probe made the most difficult voyage entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7 last year.
These winds are driven by heat escaping from the planet's core.
"None of the normal things that would have indicated problems have shown up." The cracks also could be caused by Europa's flexing tides.
From the data taken by Galileo, scientists have determined that Io has a two-layer structure.
But the question is becoming more than a matter of scientific speculation.
The ocean theory was suggested by data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft.
Each arc ranges from 45 miles to 120 miles in length.
Radio signals streaming back from Galileo did not show any signs of major trouble, though.
But the key question is what could be conducting those currents.
The craft went back into normal mode on Wednesday after technicians sent it a series of commands.
