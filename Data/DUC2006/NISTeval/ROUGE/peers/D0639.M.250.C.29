The United States has no reason to oppose a fact-finding mission to a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant it bombed last if it is certain that deadly chemical agents were being produced there, Sudan's foreign minister said.
Facing questions about the U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, the Clinton administration sought to justify the strike by offering more details linking the factory to the production of chemical weapons.
Struggling Sudan got economic help, and Iraq was able to move ahead with chemical weapons far away from the gaze of U.N. weapons inspectors.
On Aug. 20, the United States launched a cruise missile attack that destroyed a Sudanese factory, which the U.S. government claimed was making precursors for VX nerve gas.
U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
But he said the evidence pointing to new attacks did not include the location of potential targets.
The Soviet Union produced at least that much of a similar agent called V-gas, and also has vast stockpiles.
Workers there mixed pre-formulated chemicals into medicines, he said, and lacked the space to stockpile or manufacture other chemicals.
The small amount of intelligence information released by the Clinton administration to justify the attack contrasts with the detailed intelligence made public by other administrations to justify military strikes.
