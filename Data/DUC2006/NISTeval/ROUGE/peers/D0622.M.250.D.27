In recent weeks, New York has sprayed pesticide throughout Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn to kill mosquitoes.
Last year, seven people died and 55 others were infected in the New York metropolitan area during the first known appearance of the virus in the Western Hemisphere.
This year, 13 people have been infected in New York and four in New Jersey, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The virus also has been detected in birds in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania officials Wednesday said they had found the virus in two dead crows outside Philadelphia.
Fearing the infection might spread with the fall bird migration, experts also are testing dead birds from Maryland to Florida.
Chickens are used to monitor the prevalence of encephalitis viruses because the mosquitoes that spread them feed on birds.
This year will be the first season county health workers routinely test chicken blood for West Nile virus, he said.
That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the United States until August; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
Four pools of mosquitoes collected in Bergen County in late July have tested positive for the virus, but none of the 10,000 mosquitoes analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control, sentinel chickens or sparrows have tested positive.
