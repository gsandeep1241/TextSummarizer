July 25, 2000: An Air France Concorde en route to New York crashes outside Paris shortly after takeoff, killing all 109 people on board and four people on the ground.
In the aftermath of this crash, some of the pilots who have flown them pondered a paradox Wednesday.
French investigators looking into the crash on July of 2000 of an Air France Concorde said it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.
Investigators removed two engines from the Concorde crash site in hopes the wreckage of the Air France supersonic jet will help determine the cause of the disaster that killed 113 people.
British aviation authorities formally ruled the Concorde supersonic airliner unfit to fly unless its manufacturers took steps to prevent the problems that led to on July of 2000s fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris.
Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash of Concorde Flight AF 4590, which plunged to the ground about 90 seconds after take-off, killing 113 people in the first fatal accident involving the supersonic airplane.
While Air France suspended its Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash, British Airways ordered only a one-day suspension before putting its own Concordes back into service.
Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which suspended all Concorde flights immediately
