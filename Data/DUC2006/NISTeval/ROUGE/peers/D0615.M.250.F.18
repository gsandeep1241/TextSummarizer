Operating on a ``frayed, shoestring budget,'' the center can help mount a counterattack on creationism in public schools.
The center supplies concise articles and pamphlets refuting the claims of creation science, legal advice and summaries of court cases involving creationism, tips on writing letters to the editors of local newspapers, advice on how to explain issues to reporters, phone numbers of national experts on evolution, links to dozens of organizations that can offer help, and the phone numbers of other people in their state who are willing to get involved.
``It's the denial of what understanding we have of the origin of the universe in terms of modern science,'' said Jerome Friedman, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1990 for collaborating in the discovery of the subatomic particles called quarks and is the president of the American Physical Society.
Because the adoption of standards in science or any other subject can not be dictated under state law, it will be up to each district to decide whether to follow the lead of the state board, which periodically issues guidelines suggesting what should be taught in the state's classrooms.
Rather than banning outright the teaching of evolution and anything related to it, such as the origin of the universe, the board, in what was described as a compromise, opted to leave it it up to local school districts to decide if those subjects would be included in their curricula.
