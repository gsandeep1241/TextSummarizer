HOUSTON - To prevent school violence, suburban and rural school districts should consider some measures used by their urban counterparts, experts and educators say.
SEATTLE - The sheer magnitude of the slaughter at Littleton's Columbine High School has put Puget Sound-area schools on high alert and prompted sober reviews of school security, including a special meeting this week between Seattle police and school officials.
A bomb was found near the school campus Thursday after school officials and parents gathered to discuss the alleged plot by the four students at the school.
Bill Modzeleski, director of the department's safe and drug-free schools program, said statistics for the 1998-1999 school year just completed are not yet available because of a lag time in reporting from local school districts and state education agencies.
Timothy Crawford, Jackson County's school district attorney, said he is concerned about lawsuits, but believes the plaques in the district's five schools are allowed by law because they were paid for and posted by local volunteers and not sponsored by the district.
And others, including the New York City school district, are considering it as a means to get a handle on the problem of school violence.
Solid information on how schools reacted to Littleton should emerge from a school survey on crime and safety that was mailed to a sample of 3, 000 school principals last month, said the survey's director, Kathryn Chandler of the Education Department.
