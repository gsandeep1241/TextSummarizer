WASHINGTON _ In 1989, the Senate removed Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Mississippi from the bench for lying before a federal grand jury.
At sentencing, U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans believed the federal sentencing guidelines called for Holland to receive lenient treatment because he committed perjury in a civil _ and not a criminal _ proceeding.
Clinton's chief defense is to quote the following testimony from Lewinsky: "I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence".
But whenever the White House quotes this line, it neglects to supply the rest of the testimony, in which Lewinsky said: "The best way to explain how I feel what happened was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one discouraged me either".
It is the discrepancy between these two quotes from Lewinsky that has led the House managers to conclude that her testimony before the Senate is crucial.
Or, as the impeachment article puts it, Clinton made "prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony in a Federal civil rights action brought against him".
Clinton's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case did not include oral sex.
"The Senate should not establish a lower standard for integrity for the president than the standard it has already established for federal judges," Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla.
, said.
