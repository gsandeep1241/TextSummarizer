French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff.
All 109 people aboard were killed as well as five on the ground.
Air France issued a one-paragraph statement on its lawsuit, saying it had been filed in the Pontoise commercial court, which covers the town of Gonesse, where the plane had dropped onto a small wooden hotel.
French investigators looking into the crash last month of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.
In their statement Thursday, the investigators said that the bursting of the tire while the plane was moving down the runway at about 195 mph threw up large pieces of the tire, some of them weighing as much as 9 pounds.
The tire, hot from friction, exploded, sending chunks of rubber as heavy as 8 pounds flying upward with such force that they punctured the huge triangular left wing.
The plane lifted off, but as the jet fuel ignited, the left-side engines malfunctioned.
