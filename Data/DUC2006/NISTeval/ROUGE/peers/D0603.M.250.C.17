The new organization links the Asian Wetland Bureau, Wetlands for the Americas and the International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau. Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988 . Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth ' s `` kidney '' include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land . The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by China ' s Ministry of Forestry, Japan ' s Environment Agency and Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands and water birds in Beidaihe . Americans destroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that these swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing floodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap water . The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist : the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development . Environmentalists say more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year, about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national permit system . This change could make a big difference . These areas play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and in harboring fish and shellfish populations
