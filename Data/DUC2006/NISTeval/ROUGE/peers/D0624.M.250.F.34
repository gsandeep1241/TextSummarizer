LONDON _ A long-awaited government report has found London's police force to be ``riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism'' and suggests that chief officers must accept that conclusion as a condition for keeping their commands.
The report, which surprised leaders of Britain's non-white communities with its sweep and bluntness, makes 70 recommendations for changes in police practices and social habits ``designed to usher in a fundamental transformation of Britain's race relations''.
Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government inquiry, defined institutional racism as ``the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin'' reflected, he said, in ``processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping''.
His report said, ``There must be an unequivocal acceptance of the problem of institutionalized racism and its nature'' and that ``any chief police officer who feels unable to respond will find it extremely difficult to work in harmony and cooperate with the community in the way that policing by consent demands''.
The judicial recommendation, in effect eliminating protection against ``double jeopardy,'' addresses the case that gave rise to the report, the 1993 killing of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old Londoner of Jamaican parentage, by five white youths with a history of race baiting.
