Ottawa, August 20 (Xinhua) -- the Supreme court of Canada ruled here Thursday that Quebec can't separate from the country unilaterally.
The split decision stems from the geographical distribution of political support in Quebec.
Even the local Liberal candidate is perplexed by the Quebec paradox.
The Quebec issue has been dogging Canada in the past several decades.
The big difference was Canada and Britain wanted Newfoundland to switch allegiances.
A clear majority would be needed for a referendum to pass.
It is widely expected that Quebec will hold a provincial election next year.
This view is shared by an overwhelming 75 percent of Quebecers.

Separatists have often tried to portray the process of secession as straightforward and relatively painless.
Quebec politicians wasted no time in calling Tuesday's decision political.
People in the province voted to stay in Canada instead of separation in the October referendum two years ago.
The election results keep the independence movement alive, but it is wounded.
Voters sided with Bouchard even though the support for separation has declined.
About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French speakers.
"And it is the future of Canada that is at stake."
