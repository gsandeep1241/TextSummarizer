Top medical experts have flown to Kenya's Northeastern Province to investigate the mysterious disease which claimed over 160 lives in the last four days, local press reported today.
Local press quoted James Mwanzia, Director of Medical Services, as saying Tuesday that the experts listed 12 possible diseases including yellow and Rift Valley fevers, Marburg fever and severe malaria.
Mwanzia said that the disease which is said to kill people within 36 hours could be a mix of malaria and dysentery because of the flooding caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the warm spell which followed.
It is said that the AIDS threat has reached disaster proportions with both private and public organizations incurring costs of as high as 200 million shillings (about 2.7 million U.S. dollars) daily on HIV/AIDS-related expenses.
More Kenyan risk contracting the dreaded AIDS disease if measures are not taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic, Kenya Times newspaper Thursday quoted the official as saying.
Africans are highly suffering from communicable diseases and illnesses related to food deficiencies, he pointed out, saying that malaria, tuberculosis and diarrhoeal diseases could be controled if proper and agreeable inter-country collaborative strategies regarding the above mentioned diseases were drawn.
The health conference is organized by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health in collaboration with the directorate general for Development of Cooperation of Italy, the WHO and Institutes Superiore Di Sanita Italy.
