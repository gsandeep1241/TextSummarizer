Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
In an accompanying commentary, Dian J. Gaffen of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland, cautioned against ``making too much of these new indications of warming'' because the satellite data covers a short period and other factors could be at work.
The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6 to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming the tropics but cooling the polar regions.
Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
American Scientist Disputes Global Warming Theory Scientists have become more and more concerned about the possible health consequences of global warming.
The scientists said that the warming effect, especially rising temperatures in winter, will result in a series of changes to nature and human society.
In its first overview of the link between agriculture, global warming and climate change, Eurostat said that agriculture is the main source of methane and nitrous oxide, but total emissions of these gases are small compared to that of carbon dioxide.
They said that the changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects
