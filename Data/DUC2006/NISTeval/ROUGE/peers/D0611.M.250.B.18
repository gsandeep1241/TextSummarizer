In the summer Sunnyside is opening a market in an 1835 building Cole is restoring in the center of the tiny town of Washington, Va., less than a block from his most prestigious customer, the Inn at Little Washington.
Cole, 47, calls his system network farming: a large central farm is the hub, with smaller nearby farms the spokes, their production marketed through the hub.
Sunnyside's system is designed to show that diversified organic farming, with a mix of vegetables, fruits and animals, can be profitable while protecting the environment, not only from tract housing but also from the damage done to it by traditional farming methods.
Delaware Park has become a sort of testing ground for environmentally friendly groundskeeping.
The park's rose garden is being tended with organic compound and soon will be watered with a drip-irrigation system, rather than sprinklers, which soak the whole plant and encourage fungus growth, and in turn, pesticide use.
The arboretum has been managed by Leyhill since the prison acquired it in the 1940s.
Leyhill also maintains pasture land for raising rare Gloucester cattle and runs a museum of old farm machinery in the prison's Tortworth Visitors 'Center, which also includes a farm stand.
By definition, organic farming eschews artificial fertilizers and pesticides, instead harnessing the power of natural substances, such as compost, bacteria and pest-targeted insects and protective netting, to build healthy soil and keep invading forces at bay.
Organic gardeners don't use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides on plants.
