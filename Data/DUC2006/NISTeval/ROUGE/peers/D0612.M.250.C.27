When milder forms of autism like Aspberger's syndrome are included, the incidence is one in 500.
The common feature among all children with autism is a lack of social relatedness.
By age 2 or 3, autistic children display a profound lack of responsiveness to others.
Scientists for the first time have discovered what they believe may be biological markers in the blood of newborn infants who later develop autism and mental retardation.
The finding supports what many experts believe may be the root cause of both autism and mental retardation: faulty wiring present from birth.
The discovery, presented by scientists at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in San Diego, still needs to be replicated in larger studies.
The research, described for the first time publicly Wednesday by Dr. Karin B. Nelson, a neurologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md., was carried out by that institute in collaboration with the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program in Berkeley and George Washington University Medical Center in Washington.
The world of autism research is littered with false hopes, he said, but this could bring new ways of attacking the problem at a basic scientific level.
Early in development, fetuses get VIP from the mother's immune cells.
After birth, the baby makes VIP in parts of the brain that underlie cognition, learning and memory and also in other parts of the body, including the intestines, where it dilates tissues.
