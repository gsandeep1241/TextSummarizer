Russia's anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus "will be carried out to the end, and the hotbed of international terrorism will be wiped out.
"The liberation of Chechnya is the goal set for the federal armed forces.
Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
They have been linked to terrorist bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities this month.
They detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to re-enter Chechnya, Russian media reported Saturday.
Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks.
He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels.
The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out terrorist acts.
Meanwhile, it warned of more possible terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels, saying that the rebels have changed their tactics and are planning a series of bombing operations in the republic.
Preliminary reports indicate that 36 Russian servicemen were killed and another 74 injured in five terrorist attacks in Chechnya, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced here Monday.
