The safety board is expected to release more information from the flight data recorder.
The safety board is still investigating the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 in these same waters.
Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said.
It had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York.
Egyptian and U.S. investigators "were seeking to know exactly what happened to the EgyptAir plane.
The remains of the first victims of EgyptAir Flight 990 have been identified, four months after the plane plunged.
The flight data show the plane's elevators were uneven during the rapid descent.
Information from the plane's flight data recorder, one, should tell investigators if a thruster deployed.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
Black Boxes" are the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, two vital instruments.
Hall said the flight data recorder indicates the plane did not reach such speeds.
`There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir
