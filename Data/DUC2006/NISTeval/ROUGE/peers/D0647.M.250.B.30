Concerning the custody battle, CUBA-ELIAN MIAMI Demonstrators sang and prayed outside the home where Elian Gonzales is staying as all sides in the custody battle waited for a federal appeals court ruling that could lead to the boy 's reunion with his father..
The child was rescued on Nov. 25, he became the subject of an international custody dispute between his father in Cuba and their relatives in the United States, who fought unsuccessfully all the way to the Supreme Court to block his repatriation.
The relatives have said they would obey the law, including a court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian 's father, but until Tuesday night, they had never agreed to turn the child over to his father, repeatedly asking for further legal review of whether the child should be returned to Cuba.
The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian 's father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
Concerning the resolution, she affirmed Vietnam 's consistent stance of resolute demand that the United States immediately end the anti-Cuban embargo and strictly observe the Immigration Agreement signed in 1994 and 1995 between the governments of Cuba and the United States, under which the United States pledged to return to Cuba all illegal Cuban deportees.
