There are an estimated 1.7 million autistic persons in India suffering from developmental disorder that affects communication and social abilities of people.
Like other brain researchers, scientists who study autism were startled by recent discoveries that the human brain continues to make new brain cells not just new connections.
Inspired by new findings on the way animal brains develop before and after birth, scientists are developing provocative new theories to explain autism, a mysterious brain abnormality that prevents human infants from developing normal social and cognitive skills.
The leading proponent of the idea that MMR vaccine may cause cases of autism is Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free and University College Medical School.
The markers consist of abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals that help construct the basic architecture of animal brains.

An Illinois mother persuaded scientists to try a bizarre-sounding experiment, testing whether vancomycin might help her son's severe autism.
Because autistic people need a stimuli-controlled environment, as well as fairly constant training in communications, behavior management and task completion, generic programs don't work and even can harm those with autism.
In addition to the autism research centers, the bill would create a greater role for parents in the National Institutes of Health funding decisions, a gene and tissue bank of autism materials, and a national autism awareness program.
