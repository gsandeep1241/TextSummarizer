The study's early findings showed that the children who took the drug improved far more than children who were treated with only therapy.
Jensen said the problem is that thousands of children aren't treated and more than one-half of children with the disorder have not been diagnosed.
Referring to findings from sophisticated brain-imaging equipment, other experts insisted people with ADHD suffer from identifiable brain disorders.
Doctors may be overdiagnosing some groups of children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and overprescribing drugs to treat the condition, according to a new study published Wednesday.
Most cases of adult diagnosis occur in those whose childhood disorder was not identified.
When a friend with a similar history was diagnosed, he said it prodded his interest.
Using a radioactive ``label,'' scientists have demonstrated abnormally high concentrations of a key brain protein in seven adults who had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.
For a diagnosis of ADHD under the new guidelines, a child must exhibit symptoms in at least two settings, such as at home and at school.
Experts, including Koplewicz, say that children with mental illness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much higher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later on in life.
Parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz.
