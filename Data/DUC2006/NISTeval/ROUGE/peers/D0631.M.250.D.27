After the July 25 crash, French investigators said they believed that a metal strip on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris had caused a tire to burst.
The blow-out caused chunks of rubber to rupture fuel tanks located in the wings close to Concorde's four jet engines.
Concorde's spindly, stork-like landing gear is positioned directly below the wings and engines.
But, while Air France suspended its Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash, British Airways ordered only a one-day suspension before putting its own Concordes back into service.
Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash of Concorde Flight AF 4590, which plunged to the ground about 90 seconds after take-off, killing 113 people in the first fatal accident involving the supersonic airplane.
British Airways, the only other Concorde operator, grounded its entire fleet of seven Concordes on Tuesday after learning that the airworthiness certificate would be revoked Wednesday.
On Wednesday, some 100 technicians carefully removed two engines from the site of the crash to a special location at Dugny, near Le Bourget airport north of Paris.
The withdrawal of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority was the first such action against a commercial airliner in more than 20 years.
