George W. Bush had not quite finished as governor of Texas in 1995 when the first death penalty cases of his administration landed on his desk.
Bush has presided over the executions of 111 men and one woman, far more than any other governor in any other state since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty.
The governor's critics describe the Texas system for capital crimes as the most unfair and merciless of the 38 states with a death penalty, saying it deprives the accused of adequate legal aid and appeals.
Every presidential candidate supports capital punishment.
Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor has only limited power to stop an execution.
Texas executed Spencer Goodman, David Hicks and Larry Keith Robison.
What was a little surprising to me is the number of people who think Texas has executed innocent people.
Even supporters of capital punishment have been troubled by the Penry case.
Knocked by death penalty protesters while on the presidential campaign trail, Texas Gov. George W. Bush isn't likely to lose votes because of his support of the death penalty.
