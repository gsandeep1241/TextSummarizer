The ocean theory was suggested by data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
Galileo, which was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995, has in recent months experienced problems with its stabilizing gyros and computers as years of radiation from the solar system's largest planet have taken their toll.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by robotic space probes, scientists said at an all-day seminar on the latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter.
Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have concluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is similar to that on Earth but is generated by heat from a completely different source: from deep in the planet, not from sunlight.
Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest
