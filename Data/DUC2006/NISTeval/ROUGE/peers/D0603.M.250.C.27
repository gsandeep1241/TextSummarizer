Slivers of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a region's water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a Hudson River environmental organization.
The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
The EPA had sought as early 1993 to subject all development on wetlands to strict environmental review, but that approach was rejected by the courts, which ruled in favor of arguments made by developers and by the National Mining Association.
The United States still loses more than 100,000 acres a year of wetlands, but Clinton hopes to reverse the trend by 2005, creating 100,000 acres more than are destroyed.
The main tool would be the restoration of wetlands that were damaged in the past, such as the Florida Everglades.
The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development.
Until the Army Corps of Engineers realized what the resort had done in July, no one noticed the temporary road had been built in the wrong spot and was spilling sediment into protected habitat.
The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to $27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna.
