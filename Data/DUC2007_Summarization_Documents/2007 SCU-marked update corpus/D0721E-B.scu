the federal government to pass and expand hate-crime measures, but fewer than half the states have passed such measures, and Wyoming remains one of eight states with no hate-crime laws.</line><line>Federal lawmakers last week dropped provisions of a bill that would have expanded the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by victim's sexual

Kinney's court-appointed lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for Shepard's death.</line><line>But in mounting a defense designed to bring a prison term, rather than execution, Tangeman argued that McKinney's past, as well as his poor judgment, led him to drug addiction and alcohol abuse.</line><line>Tangeman told jurors that McKinney had been using large amounts of methamphetamine in the days before the killing and was drinking heavily in the hours before he and Henderson encountered Shepard at a local bar.</line><line>But in disputing Rerucha's contention that Shepard's sexual orientation played no role in events leading to the killing and that McKinney was driven solely by greed and violence, Tangeman argued that McKinney was &quot;haunted by a past, that put him into a rage, put him into a five-minute emotional rage of chaos.&quot;</line><line>The distinction is important.</line><line>If prosecutors can prove malicious intent and premeditation, they have a better chance of winning a death sentence.</line><line>If defense lawyers can show the killing evolved from a moment of passion or rage, they may persuade the jury to find the defendant guilty of a lesser charge, like manslaughter.</line><line>But even if prosecutors put on an air-tight case, it might be difficult to win a death sentence.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1"
