which had a long New York run, as well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.</line><line>The play, which chronicled Wilde's downfall, was based, in part, on trial transcripts, trials that eventually send the homosexual Wilde to prison for &quot;gross indecency.&quot;<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="42"/></line><line>&quot;The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender, sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism,&quot;

defense has no statutory basis, but it has been invoked in other cases.</line><line>Typically, the argument is that the attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is provoked to kill the victim.</line><line>In other words, the attacker should not be held fully responsible for acts triggered by his own homophobia.</line><line>Excusing violence motivated by prejudice would not be tolerated in racist attacks against ethnic minorities, and should not be allowed to stand in cases involving attacks against gays.</line><line>Voigt's ruling leaves open the possibility that testimony about McKinney's childhood sexual abuse could be presented in the penalty phase of the case.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="41"/></line><line>Childhood abuse would clearly be relevant in sentencing deliberations.</line><line>But that is quite a different matter from allowing anti-gay hatred to be employed as an affirmative defense for criminal acts.</line></document><document name="NYT19991108.0410"><line>Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="9" sums="36,40,43,46,47,52,53,55,58"><scu uid="11" label="Shepard's father asked Congress to extend federal hate crime legislation to protect homosexuals" weight="2"/></annotation></line><line>&quot;We call upon the president and Congress to come together, put all differences aside and pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act,&quot;
