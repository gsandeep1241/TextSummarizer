STAMFORD, Conn.
(AP) - Rabbi Joshua Hammerman made an uplifting discovery when he started searching for God on the Internet.
The search reaped about 2 million hits and was the brainchild for his recently released book, ''thelordismyshepherd.com: Seeking God in Cyberspace''.
Hammerman's book explores the reasons that people are using the Internet to find faith.
''Most people of Generation X are searching for a way back to religious faith, but the forms and the metaphors some traditions use in their denominations just don't resonate with them,'' Hammerman said.
''The whole notion of God as the pastor leading the flock of congregations and parishes, most people now can't relate to that,'' Hammerman said.
Generation X _ that youthful, ``slacker'' generation _ is facing a quiet crisis.
``We think of ourselves as not really that together and not really very grown up,'' said Kristin Beck, a Bay-area writer who hit the big 3-0 last April.
After reading up on adult development, she and colleague Lauren Dockett interviewed more than 30 women about ``lessons learned and dreams examined'' as they reached their first scary ``decade'' birthday.
``Love and career and babies: Those are the big things''.
Graying baby boomers may snort at the thought of Gen-Xers wringing their smooth, unlined hands over the trauma of aging, but Beck says ix-nay on the condescension.
