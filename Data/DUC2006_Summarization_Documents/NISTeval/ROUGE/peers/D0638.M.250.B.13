NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface.
The Galileo spacecraft, which has been orbiting Jupiter and its four largest satellites has produced pictures at closer range that strengthened the global-ocean hypothesis.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
To the gravitational studies, Galileo has measured magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter and its moons.
Initial analysis of early data from Galileo probe has encouraged scientists to review their theories of planetary evolution, according to scientists at a NASA press conference.
Equipped with 10 scientific instruments, Galileo, the 2.5-ton unmanned probe launched will fly only 840 kilometers above Ganymede's surface at 2:29 a.m.

A probe that plummeted into Jupiter's atmosphere sampling its composition found more than twice the concentration of volatile elements like argon and nitrogen than expected, raising questions about standard theories of how the planets formed.
There was plucky Pioneer 10, the first to reach Jupiter and then Saturn.
Electricity is produced. Scientists..
