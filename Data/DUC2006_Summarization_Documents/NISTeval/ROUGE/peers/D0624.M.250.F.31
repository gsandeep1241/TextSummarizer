The Macpherson report denounced the Metropolitan Police as fundamentally racist for its handling of the investigation into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, stabbed to death by white youths in 1993.
The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south -east London in 1993.
Think of the impact in the United States of the recent conviction of a white racist in the Texas dragging case, and of the shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant early last month by police officers in the Bronx.
Sarah Marshall said British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately.
Three of the suspects were acquitted in a civil prosecution brought by the Lawrences, but the report calls for allowing even those acquitted of crimes to be tried again if new compelling evidence emerges.
Recently, it staged extracts from the Nuremberg trials, from hearings at the Hague into war crimes in Bosnia, and from an official inquiry into British arms exports to Iraq. The brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence, 18, by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate adequately prompted a national debate on racism and how police handle such crimes.
