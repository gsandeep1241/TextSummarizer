Bush has said he supports the death penalty and doesn't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration.
But Goldford said at worst the Texas death penalty issue at this point is only ``slightly negative'' for Bush.
Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
A profile of Bush in Talk magazine in 1999 described a scene, which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized, in which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed.
IN TEXAS, DOUBTS ON EXECUTIONS.
In Will Bush's five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed 131 prisoners _ far more than any other state.
In Texas, which led the nation in executions before Bush took office, public support for capital punishment is wide and deep.
HOUSTON _ George W. Bush had not quite finished his second week as governor of Texas in 1995 when the first death penalty cases of his administration landed on his desk.
Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor has only limited power to stop an execution.
``People reasonably expect that the governor of Texas ought to be concerned about executing the mentally retarded, or those who had poor legal representation,'' said Bright.
