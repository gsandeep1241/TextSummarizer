Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself, researchers say.
That's Io, a moon of Jupiter that is sort of an energy hell.
The power causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of Jupiter.
Io is 2,236 miles in diameter, slightly larger than the Earth's moon.
The other major moons are Gannyede, Europa and Callisto.
Jupiter has at least a dozen smaller moons.
Jupiter's other major moons are Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.
It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway through an $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and other moons.
Sunday's was the last of eight Europa encounters during the extended mission, which anticipates 14 different orbits around Jupiter.
It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway through a $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and other moons.
Surrounding Europa are magnetic patterns that are typical of fields generated by electric currents, Schubert said.
Unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system _ has earthlike aspects.
Despite these slight similarities to Earth, Jupiter and its moons are far stranger than anything seen on this planet.
Europa is about the size of Earth's moon.
When Europa is closer to Jupiter, the tides are higher because the planet's gravitational tug is greater.
When Europa is farther away, the tides fall.
