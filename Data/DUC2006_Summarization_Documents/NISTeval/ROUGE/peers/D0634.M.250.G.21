"The basic message of the listings is that salmon and the need to recover salmon has landed squarely in the urban areas of the Northwest, and not just the countryside," said Bill Bradbury, executive director of the Oregon-based group For the Sake of the Salmon, a coalition of governments, industry and environmental groups working to conserve salmon.
A poll taken last summer by Elway Research found that most residents are willing to spend money to save salmon, and most do not believe a listing of salmon under the Endangered Species Act will directly affect their lives.
But with the river's coho salmon already declared extinct, and every other species of Snake River salmon and steelhead now listed under the Endangered Species Act, the once-unthinkable idea of breaching the dams has emerged in several federal studies as the action with the best chance of restoring healthy salmon runs.
"The no-net-loss policy applies to spring, summer and fall chinook, sockeye salmon, steelhead and coho salmon if the tribes successfully re-introduce this species," said Bill Dobbins, manager of the Douglas County PUD.
_A possible model: Faced with federal listing of salmon under the Endangered Species Act, Western Washington counties may combine their salmon-recovery efforts into a giant urban Habitat Conservation Plan.
Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn in the same locality, like a specific creek.
