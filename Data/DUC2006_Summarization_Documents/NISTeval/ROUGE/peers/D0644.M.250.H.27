So for the most part the debate has not been over the availability of the surplus but over the relative merits of tax cuts, increasing spending and reducing the national debt.
Clinton's plan includes $34 billion in tax cuts over five years, $39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and projects a record $117 billion surplus.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, slammed Clinton's budget for using $1 trillion in projected surplus money for new programs rather than tax cuts.
On ABC's "This Week" White House chief of staff John Podesta said the latest House proposal, a 10 percent across-the-board tax decrease proposed by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, would cost the government $179 billion more in interest payments than if the surplus were used to pay down the national debt.
Gore would use the bulk of the surplus for spending increases, combined with smaller, targeted tax cuts.
The smaller tax-cut plan was based on CBO's earlier forecast that the budget surplus over 10 years would come to $1.78 trillion.
And the party's more ardent tax cutters were dismayed, if not aghast, when Greenspan told Congress last month that the nation would be better off using projected federal budget surpluses for debt reduction than for reducing taxes.
The basic thrust of the Republican plan is an across-the-board cut in income tax rates, estimated at $1.3 trillion over ten years, that Bush says would return the surplus to taxpayers.
