A police chief of a southern Chinese city where a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong newspapers reported Saturday.
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times.
Usually they have the characteristics of large gang members, active in large areas, committing crimes frequently and doing serious harm to society, said Liu.
China has been striking hard against violent crime, focusing on wiping out those endangering social security and public order.
Zhang Fusen, head of the Chinese delegation, told the fifth session of the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) that China will participate in United Nations activities in crime prevention and criminal justice.
The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic principles, namely "conviction and penalty according to law," "equality of everyone before the law" and "punishment commensurate with the crime." According to the report, the government will make greater effort to crack down on corruption, smuggling and other economic crimes as well as criminal acts in the new year.
China is still facing the difficult task of fighting corruption and economic crimes, according to a report recently released by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
The report on China's social situation said that although the Chinese government's position against corruption is firm, corruption, especially bribery, is still widespread and in some places severe.
