WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Friday that additional studies must be completed before his agency can determine the cause of the EgyptAir 990 crash, and he disputed an Associated Press report that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately.
Three government officials close to the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said examinations of the jet's remains have revealed no signs of a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to crash, AP reported Thursday.
``No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted,'' Hall said Friday in a statement.
One official told AP that the Boeing 767 showed no signs of mechanical problems and that ``it was doing what it was supposed to,'' before the crash.
Two other officials said the working theory remains the plane was sent into a dive shortly after takeoff from New York's Kennedy Airport.
CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Egyptian aviation officials and experts, and family members of the Egyptian victims of an EgyptAir plane crash flew Tuesday to the United States.
Aboard the same plane were 73 family members of the Egyptian victims of the EgyptAir flight 990, a Boeing 767, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the northeastern coast of the U.S. shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on the way to Cairo early Sunday.
The Egyptian family members will later fly from Yew York to the Rhode Island to identify the bodies
