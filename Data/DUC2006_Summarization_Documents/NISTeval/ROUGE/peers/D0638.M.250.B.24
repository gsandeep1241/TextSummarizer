Europa is about the size of Earth's moon.
The ocean theory was suggested by data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft.
New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
The data was collected in December 1995 when a probe set loose from the Galileo spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, plunged into the planet's atmosphere.
The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo on July 13 and entered into Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7, was the first man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet and sent back data on its way to demise.
It took the data during its flyby within 559 miles of the Jupiter's moon last December 7, as the probe passed by Io on its way to enter orbit around the Jupiter.
Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year.
Over the last two years, the target of most of the Galileo spacecraft's close encounters has been Europa.
Galileo, launched in 1989, arrived at Jupiter in December 1995 and began a two-year tour of Jupiter and its four largest moons.
The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
