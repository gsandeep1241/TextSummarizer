The drama intensified Wednesday in the Elian Gonzalez saga as Cuban President Fidel Castro announced that the boy's father was ready to fly ``immediately'' to retrieve his son, while the US government extended its deadline for taking action to return the boy to Cuba.
In Miami, it remained far from clear whether the boy's relatives would give him up voluntarily or if the area's powerful Cuban exile community would try to prevent his return home, no matter what the family decided to do.
In any event, some officials of the Cuban exile community have made it clear that they do not want the boy returned to Cuba and will stage protests to try to prevent that from happening.
The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
With local TV news being nothing more than a police lineup broken up with the occasional weather gimmick, it's good to have an option when national news breaks.
The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven- month long bitter custody battle.
