Bush indicated he was unlikely to delay Robison's execution.
Bush had no authority to halt the execution without a majority vote from the 18-member parole board.
All current board members are Bush appointees.
That is cruel and unusual punishment.
Had it not been for the u.s.
Supreme Court, Faulder most likely would have been executed.
That is the law of the land.
Texas is one of 38 U.S. states with the death penalty.
There is the affable Bush.
In a conservative state where being ``Texas tough'' is high praise, Bush's positions have been popular.
In Texas, which led the nation in executions before Bush took office, public support for capital punishment is wide and deep.
One thing that became clear from the Tucker and Lucas cases was how unclear Texas' clemency process was.
If you accept the case for capital punishment, the process that leads to execution should be a stiff assault course.
Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the death penalty.
So that's the argument; it's over now.
In just one case has Bush decided that there were enough concerns about innocence to intervene: that of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, whose confession to a Texas murder was shown to be a lie.
Graham was 17 at the time of the murder.
The same is true of other states.
At the heart of the problem is the Texas way of providing lawyers for defendants too poor to hire their own, as most are in death cases.
