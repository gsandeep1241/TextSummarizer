Russia has asked Western countries to examine their submarines that were in the Barents Sea the Kursk submarine sank, but received no answer, Klebanov told the deputies.
A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves lashing the Barents Sea near Norway.
About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went down.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
Klebanov, chairman of the commission investigating the submarine sank rejected reports that the Kursk was testing a new type of torpedo that used a liquid fuel system that some officers considered unstable.

The operation is supervised by commander-in-chief of the Russian navy Vladimir Kuroyedov and the head of the government commission, Deputy Premier Ilya
