In defiance of fresh U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to further expand settlement construction.
Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza and counted 5,892 units under construction.
The Palestinians charge that expansion of the settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace settlement.
Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting the Middle East peace process revealed that there are still 5,892 new housing units now under construction in various settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement expansion.
Israel confiscated 17,000 donums of Palestinian land to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 154 Palestinians were killed said an official report.
A senior Palestinian official repeated objection to the continued expansion of Jewish settlements, saying it could prevent the beginning of the final status negotiations and destroy the peace process.
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the total number issued in the three years tenure of the previous government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.
