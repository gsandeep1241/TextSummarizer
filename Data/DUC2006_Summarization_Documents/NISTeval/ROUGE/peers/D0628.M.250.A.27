ADHD is a neurological and genetic disorder that, Barkley said, is the most widely inherited trait of any psychiatric disorder.
Gold said that part of the difficulty of diagnosis of a psychiatric disease, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is that there are other kinds of problems that cause children to have problems sitting still or to concentrate, such as environmental exposure to lead, stressful household situations and in most extreme case, response to abuse.
``One of the key questions in the evaluation is has the child always had difficulty sitting still, sustaining attention to a task, or is this something new,'' said Gold, who added that often behavioral and other educational help is tried first before approaching medication.
What makes the order landmark is that Ritalin is a different kind of medicine, part of an emerging class of pills that treat behavior rather than disease.
In what many see as a kind of vast, national experiment, millions of children in the United States are taking drugs prescribed by doctors to help manage mental and emotional health problems at ever-younger ages.
Part of the research being described in the Lancet report was supported by Boston Life Sciences, Inc., which says it intends to develop Altropane as an ADHD test.
It has already made a test using Altropane to detect early signs of Parkinson disease, the degenerative brain disorder caused by a loss of dopamine-containing nerve cells that leads to movement and gait disabilities.
