The average global temperature will rise only if atmospheric carbon dioxide is doubled.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.

Climate scientists from around the world are in wide agreement that global warming is real.''.
Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might have a similar effect.
Global warming in the lower atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
Environmentalists are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall global warming.
Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global
