At his brief trial Sunday in Huaihua City, Hunan, Zhang was charged with `` illegally providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations and persons, '' according to his lawyer and relatives . Radio Free Asia, which was set up in 1996 and receives all of its funds from Congress, broadcasts news and other programs into China from transmitters in Central Asia and the Pacific . Congressional concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan as well as tensions between China and its southeast Asian neighbors over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea have added to the overall deterioration in relations between China and the United States . There was no immediate response by the Chinese government to the State Department report . Li Hongzhi 's `` doomsday '' remarks, filled with strong antisociety and anti-government connotations, were aimed at causing social unrest and molding public opinion for his political ambitions, said Xu Ningsheng, a professor at Zhongshan University in south China 's Guangdong Province .
