Africa (AP) _ No smoking in enclosed public places except in designated areas.
When the house speaker announced absent lawmakers would be given five minutes to appear for the vote, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel asked whether the time could be used for a smoke break.
Parliament banned smoking in most public areas of the building, including the area below the stairs, several months ago.
The bill outlaws smoking in enclosed public places like train stations and shopping malls and in the workplace.
The maximum fine for smoking at work or in public places would be 200 rand (dlrs 35).
Advertising violations could generate fines of up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).
Cigarette advertisements in South Africa on billboards and the print media already must prominently display such warnings as ``DANGER: SMOKING CAN KILL YOU,'' or ``DANGER: SMOKING CAUSES CANCER.'' Africa (AP) _ A drastic anti-smoking bill cleared a key legislative hurdle in Parliament on Friday, paving the way for clamp downs on advertising and tobacco use at work and public places.
A health committee approved the bill that has been fiercely opposed by the tobacco industry, media and advertising groups and some unions.
It outlaws smoking in public and the workplace, but provides exemptions where well ventilated and separate facilities are created for workers desperate for a puff.
The new law will enable local authorities to ban smoking in public places and to designate areas where smoking is allowed, a health spokesman of the Gauteng province was quoted as saying.
