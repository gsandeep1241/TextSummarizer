WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nineteen states got D's or F's in a report that evaluated how public schools teach evolution, raising a new issue in a continuing dispute between science and religion.
The report graded 49 states and the District of Columbia and gave the highest rankings to California, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island.
Kansas, whose standards were described as ''disgraceful,'' got the lowest grade.
The report was commissioned by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and released Tuesday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science national headquarters.
Following the six top-ranked states, four states got numerical grades in the 90s and were also given A's in the report.
Fourteen states were graded at B, seven got C, six were given D's and 13 flunked.
Iowa was not included because it has no statewide education standards, leaving that up to each local district.
Linda Holloway, former chairman of the Kansas State Board of Education, said the report was deceptive and ''very unfair''.
''Clearly they have an ax to grind about evolution,'' she said in a telephone interview.
Kansas last year rekindled the issue of teaching evolution in public schools when the state board of education, led by Holloway, approved science teaching standards that minimized the importance of evolution and omitted the big-bang theory of the origin of the universe.
Other states have considered similar curriculum changes and some state legislatures have proposed laws that would forbid completely the teaching of evolution in public schools.
