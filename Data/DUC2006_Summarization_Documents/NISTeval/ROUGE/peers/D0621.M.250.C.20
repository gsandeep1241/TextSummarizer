MACAU'S Judicial Police on announced the arrest of three alleged 14K triad members, among them two women said to be ``very close'' to the gang's detained reputed leader, Wan kuok-koi.
While applauding the arrests, Hong Kong papers said there was likely to be more such cross-border crime after the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule.
The bomb blasts were the worst in recent years, and were the first to involve journalists, indicating gang members may want to punish reporters covering their criminal activities.
The official Chinese news agency Xinhua has reported that all proceedings were appropriate under Chinese law, noting that many of the alleged crimes were plotted in China and some were carried out there.
Cheung and his gang were all arrested in China, and half of the defendants were mainland residents.
Cheung's letter of appeal argues that Cheung cannot be guilty of kidnapping if there are no victims.
Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were from mainland China, Zhang said.
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times.
China is backing the strengthening of international cooperation in fighting crime involving firearms, especially transnational firearms smuggling.
