Although the administration says the precursor has no other use than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical weapons, said another administration official, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
Amy E. Smithson of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an arms research organization in Washington, said it would not take a large amount of precursor chemicals _ or space _ to make a weapon.
Although the Dutch exporter wanted to sell the chemicals as raw materials for use in the manufacture of fertilizer, the ministry "had indications that it might be used for other ends," De Jonge said.
She also declined to say how the Dutch government decided there was a risk the chemicals would be used for military ends.
Some diplomats accuse the United States of also withholding information because its scientists did not find VX components or precursor chemicals on its second batch of samples, so as not to put its first tests into question.
On Tuesday, experts said that there is strong evidence that those outstanding samples had revealed two chemicals found in VX _ though not only in VX.
But the Iraqis would be hard-pressed to explain what the chemicals were doing on warheads that Iraq said contained other substances.
Iraq has acknowledged that it once had sufficient precursor chemicals to make nearly 500 tons of VX, but claims that all its VX stocks have been destroyed.
