The militants, who want to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Russia, entered Dagestan and fought Russian forces in August and September.
The rebels, avoiding direct clashes with federal troops, have resorted to guerrilla tactics.
The military campaign was launched following armed Chechen intrusions into the Daghestan republic and bomb blasts in four apartment buildings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
At the completion of the first stage of its campaign against Chechen rebels, federal forces have now taken control a third of Chechnya, mostly low-lying areas north of the Terek River.
Russia's air campaign had been focused on bombing suspected rebel bases, but now it is targeting economic installations and civilian communications facilities as well.
Rebel command headquarters, bases and storage facilities near the villages of Zebir-yurt, Pervomaiskoye, Raduzhnoye and Dolinsky were targeted in the latest raids, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the press service of the Russian Defense Ministry.
About 50 persons have been detained in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, eight of whom may have taken part in the suicide bombing in the city of Argun, 10 kilometers southeast of the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky on Chechnya told an interview in Moscow Wednesday.
Warplanes bombed the republic's television station in Grozny on Friday and early Saturday and damaged the equipment beyond repair, Russian media reported.
The casualties included eight Defense Ministry servicemen and 17 policemen from the Interior Ministry, according to Col. General Valery
