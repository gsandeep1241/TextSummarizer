Scientists who argue against global warming often cite nearly 20 years of satellite readings showing slight cooling of the atmosphere two miles (3.2 kilometers) up.
Before the correction, scientists were confounded because temperatures in the lower troposphere, the region from the ground to about two miles (3.2 kilometers) up, seemed to be cooling.09 degrees Fahrenheit (0.05 degrees Celsius) per decade, while the middle to upper troposphere _ a region centered about four miles (6.4 kilometers) up _ seemed to be warming.05 degrees Fahrenheit (0.03 degrees Celsius) every decade.
In an accompanying commentary, Dian J. Gaffen of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland, cautioned against ``making too much of these new indications of warming'' because the satellite data covers a short period and other factors could be at work.
Those who believe that carbon dioxide and industrial gases are heating the atmosphere say the revisions now show a slight warming trend, in line with the warming of the Earth's surface.
In its first overview of the link between agriculture, global warming and climate change, Eurostat said that agriculture is the main source of methane and nitrous oxide, but total emissions of these gases are small compared to that of carbon dioxide.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
