Vladimir Putin, the man Boris N. Yeltsin nominated as Russia's prime minister and his preferred successor as president, is a former spy, a shrewd bureaucratic operator and a completely inexperienced public politician.
That was when a twentysomething, bright Vladimir Putin, who is now Russia's acting president, majored in law there, after finishing secondary school in 1970.
Everyone expects Putin to win the presidency outright in the upcoming elections.
For a Russia that is now keen to improve and develop relations with the West, it is sensible for Putin to choose Britain as the first Western country to visit.
At this stage, the answer is unclear, in view of the fact that Putin has never run for office, and is a former intelligence official elevated to national office by aappointment.
, Putin met with Boris Yeltsin, the former president, who had anointed Putin as his heir apparent; Putin's successful manipulation of the media, to forward the government's war in the rebellious republic of Chechnya and to publicize his preferred campaign image of a tough-talking, effective leader, is one of the many reasons detractors fear him.
The third problem is that the state is insufficiently aware of its resources, Putin notes.
Bill Bradley and John McCain demand economic sanctions against Russia for its ``brutal'' assaults on Chechen civilians.
A bigger defense budget, he stressed, was a ``conscious choice,'' not related to the recent events in the North Caucasus.
