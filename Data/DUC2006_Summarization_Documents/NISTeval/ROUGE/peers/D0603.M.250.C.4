Xu said his Ministry will launch a drive to enhance the awareness of A temporary dirt logging road carved across a half-acre of wetlands has landed Vail Resorts, the nation's largest ski area, in trouble with the government.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday ordered Vail Resorts to immediately begin efforts to restore a half-acre of wetlands illegally filled during construction of a dirt logging road.
In 1996, Telluride ski area was fined $1.1 million for destroying 17 acres of wetlands.
The EPA on Friday ordered Vail Resorts to " take action now " to stabilize and winterize the road to protect the wetlands from further damage.
New regulations that will make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically sensitive areas.
The Corps completed a 172-page overhaul of its wetlands regulations this week and is ready to issue the new requirements, according to government and private sources.
The new regulations have been in the works for more than four years, but were given new impetus 18 months ago when President Clinton said he wanted to tighten the requirements on developers " to ensure that we think twice before building in our most sensitive wetlands." The new regulations will replace a "nationwide permit" system for developers that environmentalists argue provided too many loopholes to builders and led to widespread wetlands destruction.
Statistics on wetlands loss vary widely.
Several important steps remain.
