Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon.
Others announce that the United States and Canada agree on an urgent plan to rescue salmon runs in Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.
The truck would transport the juvenile fish nearly 250 miles downriver, past seven other dams in the Columbia River system, of which the Snake is a part.
The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act.
Will the elaborate, two-decade-old system for moving fish around the dams prove inadequate to save the salmon?
Over the past five years, the fishing dispute has repeatedly disrupted U.S.-Canadian relations.
And the National Marine Fisheries Service, one of several federal agencies that must weigh in on the fate of the dams, recently said that a decision on breaching could be put off for 5 to 10 years if barging was continued and other aggressive conservation measures undertaken.
Society's interest in saving fish and beaches collides at the shoreline with homeowners' determination to safeguard even small pieces of waterfront land.
We feel we've got to imitate Mother Nature the best we can,'' said Mick Jennings, a former state fisheries biologist now working for the Warm Springs Tribes.
