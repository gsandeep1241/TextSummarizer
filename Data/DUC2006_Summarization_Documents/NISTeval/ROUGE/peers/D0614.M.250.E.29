Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois won enough seats to form a majority government in 's general election in the French-speaking province of Canada.
At the same time, popular support for the separatists' provincial government, headed by Premier Lucien Bouchard, fell to the lowest point in its five-year history, around 37 percent.
The federal government is arguing that a referendum is a "consultation", not the first legal step out of the confederation.
The re-election of the PQ government was widely believed to have much impact on the future of both Quebec and the country of Canada as a whole.
Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatists' charismatic leader, is expected to hold the vote either late this year or next spring, and he plans to call another referendum on secession if he wins re-election.
In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists gained 40 percent of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province where the referendum was held.
A survey released last found 41 percent of Quebecers would vote ``Yes'' in a vote on separation.
It's about life, about Quebecois life,'' he says, but it also stresses universal characteristics like jealousy, immodesty, vanity and arrogance.
But some analysts say separatist fortunes could revive if Canada is perceived as trying to bully Quebec.
In his campaign, Charest has accused Bouchard of recklessly pursuing another referendum even though opinion polls show that Quebecers overwhelmingly oppose it.
