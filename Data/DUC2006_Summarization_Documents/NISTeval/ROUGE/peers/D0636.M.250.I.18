With a steadily shrinking market share, GM has hired few employees since the late 1970's and has 220,000 hourly workers left in the United States, mostly represented by the UAW The automaker has 600,000 employees worldwide and continues to lag rival automakers in terms of the number of autos that each worker produces annually.
The UAW's contracts with the Big Three automakers give workers the privilege of turning down transfers to work sites more than 50 miles away, and the workers have virtually guaranteed lifetime employment.
But GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these meetings has been mixed, UAW officials said in recent interviews.
The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said.
The auto makers are enjoying record sales and have accumulated huge cash reserves _ $24 billion in the case of Ford.
``Should GM decide to proceed with the sale as announced, the UAW's record is clear: we can and will aggressively work to protect the rights and interests of UAW members impacted by the sale,'' Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues, said in a statement.
The plants have been partially idled by the strike in Flint.
