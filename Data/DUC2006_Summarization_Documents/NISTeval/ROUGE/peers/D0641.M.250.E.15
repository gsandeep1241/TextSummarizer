At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global warming to changes in circulation patterns.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
Without this amplification the average global temperature will rise only about a degree Fahrenheit if atmospheric carbon dioxide is doubled.
Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global warming.
Global warming in the lower atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
'Atmospheric angular momentum is increased by the El Nio event, so it is reasonable that it should also increase with global warming''.

Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might have a similar effect.
It suggests that the length of the day could provide a means of monitoring global warming in future.
This implies that global warming is responsible for almost one-third of the slowing down in the Earth's spin scientists have measured.
'The data suggest that global warming has caused a slowdown of the Earth at a rate of 0.56 milliseconds a century.''.
The warming of the earth's surface over the last century has probably been caused by emissions of heat-trapping waste
