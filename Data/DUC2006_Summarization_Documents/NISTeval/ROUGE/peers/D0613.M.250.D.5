According to a training video, ``The X Factor: Managing and Motivating Generation X,'' that's the pet peeve list for Gen X, the work set younger than baby boomers.
GenXers crave such roadmaps in order to manage in a world where workers get downsized regardless of seniority and skills quickly grow obsolete, says Bruce Tulgan, a Generation X consultant.
Americans who are ages 18 to 35, Generation X, who were once thought of as the slacker generation, indeed slack at one duty -- voting.
Boomers are spanking X-ers at the polls in regards to those issues being addressed for the future of the younger generation.
Zaira Balmaceda, 16, a Phoenix-area high school student, provides a positive outlook for Generation Y, or the millennials, Generation X's younger counterpart.
Generation X-ers put aside their backpacks and joined hands with their parents and teachers to make a ``visible (religious) stand'' just before the start of the school day.
Too often, the younger generation is blamed for not being engaged in politics ``when the real problem is that the political system has failed to engage them,'' said Gen-X expert Mitchell.
Susan Mitchell, author of ``Generation X: The Young Adult Market'' (New Strategist, $69.95), said it's unusual for Dayton to have so many young people involved in local politics, especially party politics.
``The thing that is most striking about this generation is that they tend not to identify with any political party,'' she said.
