In 1996, the Galileo probe made the most difficult voyage entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7.
Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since 1989, is now undertaking a two year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
It took the data during its flyby within 559 miles of the Jupiter's moon last December 7, as the probe passed by Io on its way to enter orbit around the Jupiter.
Spacecraft Galileo will close in on Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede Thursday morning to gather the most detailed information ever obtained about the icy satellite.
The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
In 1998, Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for another year.
Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by robotic space probes, scientists said at an all day seminar on the latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter.
