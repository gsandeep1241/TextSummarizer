The PATH report assumed that salmon that are barged through the lower Snake River dams are considerably less likely to survive a round-trip to the Pacific Ocean than non-barged fish.
Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn in the same locality, like a specific creek.
The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act.
Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon.
The major requirement is that the dams be operated with no net loss of salmon.
Instead of hammering at historic inequities in the salmon catch -- U.S.-fishermen catch millions of salmon bound for Canadian rivers -- Anderson has put heavy emphasis on conservation.
Washington agreed last June to restrict the recreational catch of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British Columbia, and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound for the Stuart River.
The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest.
The return of coho salmon to British Columbia's central coast, Fraser said in an interview, has declined from more than 500,000 fish
