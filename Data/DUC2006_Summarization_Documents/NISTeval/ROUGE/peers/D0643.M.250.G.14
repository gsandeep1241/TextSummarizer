An increased number of hurricanes over the Atlantic ``is consistent with developing La Nina conditions,'' WMO said.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
Federal government relief, $400 million.
State assistance, $125 million.
The findings by a team of researchers add to a growing body of knowledge about the still mysterious El Nino, which has affected weather systems from South America to the U.S. Northeast.
By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
The colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures have grown into one of the strongest La Nina episodes in 50 years, according to scientists at the weather service's climate prediction center in Camp Springs, Md.
For many parts of the Americas and Asia, the occasional warming and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in, usually with little warning, then staying for months or sometimes a year or two, bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of storms and droughts, heat and cold.
When they altered the values for the magnitude of deep ocean waves at a single point in the western Pacific, the model produced El Nino at regular intervals of about four years, with perfectly predictable cycles of temperature, winds and ocean currents.
