Bush had not quite finished his second week as governor of Texas in 1995 when the first death penalty cases of his administration landed on his desk.
In Texas, which led the nation in executions before Bush took office, public support for capital punishment is wide and deep.
Because he would be out of Texas that day, Bush reviewed the inmates' clemency appeals with his legal staff, approved the executions and instructed the lieutenant governor to proceed in his absence.
A profile of Bush in Talk magazine last year described a scene, which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized, in which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed.
Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said his initiatives, especially those toughening punishment for juvenile offenders and making convicts serve longer terms, had produced a 20 percent drop in the Texas crime rate.
Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas governor's powers generally, he may have little or no discretion over Graham's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles renders its ruling on the matter this week.
Other states, including Florida, where Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, is governor, see Texas as a model of efficiency.
The confluence of events that has pushed Bush's record on capital punishment into the public eye is likely to keep it there.
