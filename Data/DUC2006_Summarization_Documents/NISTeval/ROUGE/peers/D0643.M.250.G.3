La Nina, the assertive sister of last year's hellacious El Nino, has already contributed to freakish weather around the globe and will continue to bring colder than normal temperatures to the West Coast well into spring, according to government forecasters.
The occasional warming and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino and La Nina are unwelcome visitors barging in, usually with little warning, then staying for months or sometimes a year or two, bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of storms and droughts, heat and cold.
National Weather Service experts La Nina would bring Los Angeles a drier year than normal.
Although the current La Nina conditions are following on the heels of last winter's El Nino, they often occur years apart and don't alternate in an orderly progression.
"El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time," said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate Prediction Center.
With no El Nino or La Nina, there is no sheep dog driving the sheep, no strong organizing force giving shape to the otherwise chaotic flow of weather across the seas and continents.
La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
