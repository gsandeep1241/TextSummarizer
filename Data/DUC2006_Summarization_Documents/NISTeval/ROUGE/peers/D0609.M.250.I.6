JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) - A senior U.S. official Sunday expressed Washington's deep concern over the ongoing Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, saying it will hamper the peace making between Israel and the Palestinians.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Washington said unilateral actions include Jewish settlement activity on the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians.
But Benjamin Netanyahu has been at odds with the Palestinians over Jewish settlements.

Palestinians Warn Against Continued Settlement.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who took office in July with a pledge to revive the stalled peace process, said that he will neither build new Jewish settlements nor dismantle existing ones.
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
They are the three largest settlements in the West Bank.
The international community was surprised over Israel's construction work at the Abu Ghneim Mountain and Ras al-Amoud settlements and the expansion of the Maali Adumim settlement, al-Masri said.
Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting the Middle East peace process, also revealed that there are still 5,892 new housing units now under construction in various settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement expansion.
