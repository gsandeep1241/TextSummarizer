Russia has turned down a French proposal to help it evacuate the crew of the sunken submarine " Kursk" in the Barents Sea, Agence France-Presse quoted French navy officials as saying.
Russian officials maintain that the Kursk collided with a large object such as a foreign submarine, or with a World War II mine, but they have also considered the possibility that a torpedo inside the submarine misfired.
One explanation presumes that the submarine hit a World War II mine, the second is that the Kursk collided with another submarine, and the third is that an explosion took place inside the submarine 's torpedo compartment.
Russian and NATO officials held a four-hour meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss what kind of assistance the western alliance could offer to help save the 118 crew of a nuclear submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.
Docking attempts will continue until the arrival of foreign rescuers expected evening and.
Two Norwegian ships are heading for the disaster area one the British LR5 submarine rescue craft and the other a group of Norwegian deep-sea divers.
What remains is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,'' he said.
Government says huge explosion shattered Kursk, but uncertain as to what triggered it.
But time after time, several Russian officials have brought up the idea of a collision with a Western sub.
