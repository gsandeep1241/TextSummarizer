The extraordinary meeting of the league's 22 permanent members, called at the request of Syria and the PA, will discuss new Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting the Middle East peace process, also revealed that there are still 5,892 new housing units now under construction in various settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement expansion.
Successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout the West Bank.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Without directly calling for a freeze of settlements expansion, the deal stipulates that the Israeli and Palestinian sides should refrain from taking any "unilateral step" to change the status quo of the West Bank.
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
The Palestinians, who regards Jewish settlements as violation of signed agreements, have been angered by the Israeli cabinet's approval of the construction of 2,600 new housing units in four West Bank settlements this week.
