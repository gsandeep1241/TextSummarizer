Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system _ has earthlike aspects.
Despite these slight similarities to Earth, Jupiter and its moons are far stranger than anything seen on this planet.
The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
Galileo took measurements of Europa's magnetic field during a Jan. 3 flyby 218 miles above the moon.
Galileo, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995, is not scheduled to make any more encounters of Europa.
Using instruments orbiting Jupiter on the Galileo spacecraft, researchers calculated the temperature of lava spewing from.
Photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft show that Jupiter's moon Io is aglow with colorful light.
