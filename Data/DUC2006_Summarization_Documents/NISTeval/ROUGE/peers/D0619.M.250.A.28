The Texas Republican Party recently denied recognition at its convention to the Log Cabin Republicans, a sobersided club of gay Republicans.
Ebner and other gay Republicans are accusing Maxey the only openly gay member of the Texas House and an outspoken gay rights advocate of gay baiting.
The leaflet points out that Ebner is gay, highlights his membership in the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and notes his support for expanding the state's anti discrimination laws to include sexual orientation.
He's put up by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and criticizes me for being a gay activist.
Maxey said the Log Cabin Republicans recruited Ebner to spit in the eye of the Republican party by showing that a gay, socially moderate Republican could do better against Maxey than an anti gay conservative one.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top campaign strategist defended the Republican presidential frontrunner's controversial decision to snub leaders of a gay GOP group, asserting Wednesday that the Log Cabin Republicans have been critical of Bush on several issues.
Gay Texas Republicans note that during the party's 1998 convention, Bush urged the GOP to allow the state's Log Cabin Republicans, who had been banned from setting up a booth, to do so.
Gay Republicans saw the Kolbe appearance as a historic event.
He's a living symbol of what an inclusive party is all about, said Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican organization.
