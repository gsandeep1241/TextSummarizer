WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Sudanese owner of a pharmaceutical plant destroyed by U.S. cruise missiles is seeking $50 million in compensation on the ground that his Khartoum factory was targeted because of false charges that it had terrorist links.
Salah Idris, who purchased the al-Shifa plant five months before the August 1998 bombing, will file a civil action suit in the U.S. Court of Claims in hopes of obtaining restitution.
He has retained the Washington law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue, which said in a statement that Idris will establish that al-Shifa was ''engaged only in pharmaceutical processing and packaging,'' with no connection to international terror.
President Clinton ordered the attack, alleging that the plant had links to Osama bin Laden, exiled Saudi-born millionaire suspected in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998.
The retaliatory attack against the Khartoum facility was two weeks later, coupled with cruise missile strikes against alleged terror camps in Afghanistan said to have been under bin Laden's control.
The statement by the law firm said the U.S. government has retreated systematically from declarations that high officials made two years ago to justify the attack on the plant, ''except for the claim that a chemical component of VX nerve gas known as Empta was found in a soil sample taken by a foreign agent near the plant''.
