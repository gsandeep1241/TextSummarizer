There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy.
The Federal Security Service, the Russian navy and Klebanov's commission had already rejected a German newspaper report Friday that the Kursk was hit by a new anti-submarine missile fired by a nuclear-powered cruiser, the Peter the Great.
Norwegian divers opened the inner hatch of the sunken Russian nuclear-powered submarine Kursk's ninth unit at about 1 p.m. Moscow time (0900 GMT) Monday, Russian media reported.
Russian officials say they are focusing on indications that the Kursk collided with an underwater object, possibly a foreign submarine.
Military officials claim the most likely scenario is that the Kursk struck another vessel, probably a foreign submarine.
A Russian general claimed Monday that rescuers located an object near the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk that resembled equipment from a U.S. or British ship, but a navy spokesman denied any such discovery.
Col. Gen. Valery Manilov offered no evidence for the claim, which he said supported the theory that a collision with a foreign vessel caused the explosions that killed the Kursk's 118-man crew Aug. 12.
Manilov told a news conference that Russian rescuers discovered the mysterious object 50 yards from the sunken Kursk, and was being guarded by ships from Russia's Northern Fleet.
He did not say when or how it was located or give other details, according to Russian news
