An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed.
A submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket, bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia last year, the recorders have provided no insight into the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air traffic controllers on the ground.
It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
Neither the pilot nor co-pilot of EgyptAir Flight 990 radioed any kind of distress call to air traffic controllers.
Despite the puzzling final minutes of the flight and the lack of any clear-cut cause emerging from the first analyses of the two black boxes the flight data and cockpit voice recorders Hall was optimistic that the cause would eventually be pinpointed.
"Black Boxes" are the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, two vital instruments to help determine the cause of a plane accident.
U.S. investigators are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder from the ocean depths where
