DETROIT (AP) -- With quick and peaceful negotiations, the United Auto Workers wrapped up three new contracts with American automakers that promise some 360,000 workers more money and security for the next four years.
The automakers -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and DaimlerChrysler AG -- were rewarded, too, apparently winning won the freedom they sought to reduce costs, including shedding workers.
And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry.
``The people who currently work for the automakers are all winners,'' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations.
As for the automakers, ``I doubt they would have signed it if they thought it was too much,'' Revitte said.
``They probably assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street because the economy is doing so well''.
The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments.
According to the UAW, the average DaimlerChrysler and GM worker will see gains of more than $29,000 over the life of the deal.
Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement reached Saturday.
The average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler earns $70,000 a year, while the average Ford assembler earns about $60,000.
The figure for GM is not available.
