Former coup leader Hugo Chavez elected president of Venezuela.
Chavez, who will be sworn in on Feb 2, appealed for national ``reconciliation'' and sought to assure investors that he would pursue prudent economic policies.
Those expectations may be too high for Chavez's own good.
Chavez will have to use his famed charisma to persuade Venezuelans to show patience.
``If anyone has this quality, it's Hugo Chavez''.
Caldera, 82, was catapulted to the presidency partly because of a speech he gave immediately after Chavez's coup, asking why people would fight for democracy when it ``can't even give them enough to eat''.
During his press conference Wednesday, Chavez reiterated his plans to root out corruption, review the country's oil policies and call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.
Economists say Chavez may have difficulty achieving his economic goals because of a severe recession caused by slumping oil prices.
The foreign policy of Venezuela's new president Hugo Chavez, who was sworn in Tuesday, would be based on peace, integration and the defense of human rights, Rangel said.
In his letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, published by the Presidency of the Republic, Chavez called on Clinton's attention to the matter, considered to be "of utmost importance" for Venezuela.
Venezuelans assented to the radical revision of institutions Chavez calls a ``peaceful revolution'' because they were disgusted with the old order.
Chavez said that his government cooperates with the U.S. authorities in their war against drug traffic.
