Epperson vs.
Arkansas outlawed state bans on teaching evolution in 1968, and in Edwards vs.
Aguillard, the Court ruled in 1987 that states could not require that `` creation science '' be taught along with evolution. In Missouri state school board members are appointed by the governor . e book _ first printed in 1989 by Haughton Publishing of Dallas and since sold to public schools in more than a dozen states, including Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Texas _ suggests that `` intelligent design, '' as engineered by an `` intelligent agent, '' may be a more compelling explanation than biological evolution for the wide variety found in nature . the brief debate among board members that preceded the vote, Berman refuted that position, insisting that creationism _ or `` intelligent design, '' as some evolution opponents call it _ is not a comparable theory for teaching in public schools . Kansas last year rekindled the issue of teaching evolution in public schools when the state board of education, lead by Holloway, approved science teaching standards that minimized the importance of evolution and omitted the big-bang theory of the origin of the universe .
