The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
Charest, the former leader of the federal Conservative Party, arrived in Quebec this year as the great federalist hope whom the rest of Canada had recruited to banish the separatists.
The current election mirrored the results from the 1994 election, when the PQ won 77 seats, the Liberal 47 and the Action Democratique party one seat.
The Clarity Bill immediately met with a counter-attack from Quebec separatists who unveiled legislation in Quebec City reaffirming their right to declare independence in the fashion it sees fit.
They also signal a tougher approach toward Quebec separatists following their near-victory in the most recent referendum on October 30, the paper said.
The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative majority in Monday's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125 seats to earn a new term of up to five years.
It is a district with a history of voting on the winning side, and the separatists narrowly won here in 1994.
In the final results of Monday's election, his separatist Parti Quebecois won 75 seats, two fewer than in 1994, while the Liberal Party, which favors keeping Quebec in Canada, won 48, an increase of one.
But, because of its bellwether reputation and the close 1994 result, it is one of 18 districts now held by the separatists that the Liberals are targeting in hopes of eking out a slim legislative majority.
