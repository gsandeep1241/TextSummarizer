Russian President Boris Yeltsin's announcement Friday to resign and name Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president has surprised the nation and many say the move will further boost Putin's chance of winning the presidential race.
Critics call Putin ``cruel,'' a ``dictator,'' and a ``Russian Pinochet'' who might suspend civil liberties to whip Russia into shape.
How, according to Putin's supporters, will these traits make him a good leader?
"Besides, Vladimir Putin considers it necessary to concentrate on complex issues of domestic policy of Russia," stressed the president's aide.
Even so, Putin remains a unique candidate on the scene.
Acting President Vladimir Putin defended the Russian armed forces on Tuesday, calling talk of the army's collapse ``an open lie''.
''I looked like the last scoundrel, but I decided it would be better to do that now than for her and me to suffer later,'' he says in the book, entitled ''From the First Person -- Conversations with Vladimir Putin''.
``He's full of words _ promises to end corruption, promises to build our society again _ but we don't know who he really is or who stands behind him,'' said Alexei Slavin, a Russian voter who chose ``None of the Above'' on the ballot sheet as a protest against Putin.
With President-elect Vladimir Putin moving to put his government in place, Moscow is rife with behind-the-scenes intrigue as he and his aides try to decide which politicians, economists and tycoons should be included in his inner circle.
