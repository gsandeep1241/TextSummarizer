The spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995, completed its primary mission in 1997 and will finish a 30 million, two-year extended mission in January.
Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
When the durability and longevity of spacecraft have counted most, on long voyages to the outer planets of the sun, fortune has smiled on American space scientists.
Concerning discoveries, for about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter 's moon Europa.
Concerning the probe, asked about the meaning of these findings, the project scientists said that the probe 's measurements may necessitate a reappraisal of existing views of how Jupiter evolved from the solar nebula, because most scientists believe now that Jupiter has a composition similar to that of the gas and dust cloud of the primitive solar nebula from which the planets and the Sun were formed.
Concerning any troubles, a report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the planet with extraterrestrial life.
