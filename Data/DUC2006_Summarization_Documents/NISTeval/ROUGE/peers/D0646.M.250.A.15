If President Clinton would admit he committed perjury when he said he had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, they would vote against impeachment.
Even if Clinton did lie in the deposition that does not necessarily mean he committed perjury.
Clinton can't be charged with perjury based on the testimony of a single contradictory witness.
Some Democrats have said the perjury case against the president comes down to whether Clinton touched Lewinsky in a certain manner.
Clinton has said that his statement was ``legally accurate'' because the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case was limited.``.
At another point in the Jones deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.``.
That contradicted his answers to questions in his sworn deposition in the Jones case about being alone with Ms. Lewinsky.
The heart of the case against the president is the allegation that Clinton lied before the grand jury when he said his testimony in an earlier civil case was truthful.
District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, charged with lying to a federal grand jury.
Washington _ a federal judge Monday found President Clinton in civil contempt of court for lying in a deposition about the nature of his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
