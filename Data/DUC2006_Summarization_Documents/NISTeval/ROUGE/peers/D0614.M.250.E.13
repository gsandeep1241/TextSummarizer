Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province, possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest of Canada, and possibly another referendum on independence.
Canada's Supreme Court managed to rule on the question of Quebec secession without infuriating leaders on either side of a bitter ideological divide.
As the federal government had hoped _ that Quebec had no right to secede from Canada unilaterally.
The result... reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success.
Quebec and Canada face a crucial test as Quebecers go to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence.
With popular support for Quebec's independence in remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada made a bold gamble with his country's future introducing legislation that lays out Canada's first road map for national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will never follow it.
It allows Canada's lower house to decide whether the referendum results constituted a clear majority.
