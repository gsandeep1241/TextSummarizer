They detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to re-enter Chechnya, Russian media reported Saturday.
Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives.
Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of Chechnya's capital of Grozny, then pulled back to about three miles inside the border.
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today that the Russian aim of establishing a security zone in Chechnya ``is close to completion''.
In Grozny, Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov claimed Sunday that the Russian military conceal their losses in Chechnya.
Moscow launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in Chechnya in August last year after separatists invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and allegedly carried out a series of apartment blasts in Moscow and two other Russian cities which claimed over 300 lives.
Preliminary reports indicate that 36 Russian servicemen were killed and another 74 injured in five terrorist attacks in Chechnya on Sunday, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced here Monday.
The latest report shows that the casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached over 100, said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
