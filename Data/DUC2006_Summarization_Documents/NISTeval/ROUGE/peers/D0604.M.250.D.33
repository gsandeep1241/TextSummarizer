Retailers Prepare for 'Star Wars' Although ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened in the United States and Canada on May 19, it won't be released in many Asian and European nations until mid- to late summer.
Japan, the world's second largest movie market, is home to legions of Star Wars fans, and the film has been heavily hyped by the media in the weeks leading up to its first showing.
That was the response to the two-minute trailer _ just the preview, mind you _ for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas' latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the ``Star Wars'' trilogy.
And starting April 30, Denver will host the Lucasfilm Ltd.-sanctioned ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a three-day fan festival at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum with ``Phantom Menace'' sneak peeks, appearances by many of the film's stars, including young Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a.
Darth Vader), and a marketplace hawking merchandise from all the ``Star Wars'' films.
In a phone interview, he says he's seen the first three ``Star Wars'' films ``200 times each easily,'' has downloaded from the Internet at least seven copies of the first ``Phantom Menace'' trailer and is organizing via the Web his own group of fans to see the film on opening day.
In May, the merchandising and food promotion blitz for the long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie, ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' is scheduled to open.
