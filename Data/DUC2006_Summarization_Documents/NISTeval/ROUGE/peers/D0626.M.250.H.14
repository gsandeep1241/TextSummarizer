FBI agents have returned to a white two-story house in a new development on the outskirts of Nairobi believed to be the one rented by a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombing in Kenya that killed 248 people, the new tenants said Saturday.
Two suspects have been charged in the deaths and are being held by police in Dar es Salaam.
One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year of planned terrorist attacks against them.
Investigators believe that Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
It accuses five men of conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is suspected of organizing the simultaneous bomb attacks on the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya as well as other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.
The indictment brings to 14 the number of men known to have been charged by federal prosecutors in their investigation of the embassy bombings and bin Laden's global organization.
In the latest indictment, prosecutors suggest the two attacks were coordinated so as to occur almost simultaneously in the two countries, under the supervision of members of bin Laden's group.
The United States is concerned over more "terrorist" attacks by forces of Osama bin Laden, the man allegedly linked with last year's U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, CIA Director George Tenet said Tuesday.
