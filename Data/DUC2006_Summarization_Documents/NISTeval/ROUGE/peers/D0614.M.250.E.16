Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum.
In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists gained 40 percent of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province where the referendum was held.
``The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government it has,'' Charest said.
In a 1995 referendum on independence, the restive province of Quebec came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging Canada into its darkest political hour in decades.
Giving unity a nudge, Bill Clinton and Jacques Chirac, leaders of the two foreign countries that the people of Quebec most care about, the United States and France, came to Quebec this fall and pointedly praised Canada's federal system of government.
The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from the country.
But Quebec insists that any decision on independence must be made only by the people of Quebec.
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada ruled here Thursday that Quebec can't separate from the country unilaterally.
"The result tonight...
reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success," he noted .
