With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
Apart from the daily TV accounts of Putin's activities as president and his trips to the provinces, there are few signs that Russia is less than three weeks from a critical election.
Prikhodko said that "in compliance with the existing practice in Russia, prime minister and president do not leave the country at the same time, and therefore it will be difficult for Vladimir Putin" to make trips overseas before the upcoming general election.
Crisscrossing the vast country on trips described as official business, the acting president has reached out to interest groups, building support for the March 26 presidential election -- and giving himself an apparently unbeatable lead.
Under the law, the inauguration of the president should take place 30 days after the official publishing of the election results, that is on May 7,2000, " Veshnyakov told the Russian RTR television station.
Putin gave no hints Monday as to who he favors to head his new government, saying only that cooperation is needed from all political parties and that the results of the elections will have to figure into his decision making.
On a campaign trip to the southern city of Voronezh, Putin was cautious about the outcome of the March 26 election, saying he would prefer a clear decision to avoid a runoff.
