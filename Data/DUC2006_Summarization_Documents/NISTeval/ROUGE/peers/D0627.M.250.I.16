The anxiety among prospective parents -- and among adoption practitioners throughout the United States -- stems from a series of new laws in Russia that promise to radically alter adoption practices within that country and, as a result, possibly change the face of international adoption.
In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different: it is for parents.
The Adoptive Families of America's current ``Guide to Adoption'' contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which advertise foreign programs.
The Holts, who were Baptist, believed, with missionary fervor, that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families.
Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries.
In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.
Brownback said that could happen largely because an American central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current international adoption process.
The resulting procedures and regulations for agencies, he said, would increase costs that could drive some prospective parents out of the market.
