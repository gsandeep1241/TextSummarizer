Ever since, to develop positive relations with Japan has been one of the top priorities in Mongolia's foreign policy, with economic cooperation having a major role.
Canadian Senate speaker Gildas Molgat has announced that his country will give financial aid to Mongolia and set up an honorary consulate here to promote economic and trade relations between the two countries.
One important part of Mongolia's foreign policy, he said, is to strength friendly relations and cooperation with China, which is not only in the interests of the two countries, but also favorable for peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region.
During Bagabandi Kuwait tour, the two countries are expected to sign an economic cooperation agreement to build a 180-kilometer road in Mongolia valued at 59.4 million U.S. dollars to be funded by Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.
In his first speech published after he took office late last month, Amarjargal said it is the call of the times to add economic diplomacy to the work of the ministry, for the economic relations between Mongolia and other countries bear a special significance for Mongolia's further development.
Some international organizations and foreign countries vowed here Tuesday to provide 320 million U.S. dollars in loans and aid to Mongolia to help it overcome economic difficulties and to assist in the transition to a market economy.
