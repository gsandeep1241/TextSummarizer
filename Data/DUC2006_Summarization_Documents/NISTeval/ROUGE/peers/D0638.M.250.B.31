The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
Because of increasing interest in Europa 's watery past or present, NASA is making plans for a spacecraft to be launched in 2003 and go into an orbit of the Jovian moon in 2008.
Galileo was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989.
Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year.
Within five years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
If Galileo's operations and the subsequent transmission of data to Earth occur as planned, NASA said, selected images of Ganymede will be released in a televised news conference on July 10.
The ocean theory was suggested by data from NASA 's Galileo spacecraft.
