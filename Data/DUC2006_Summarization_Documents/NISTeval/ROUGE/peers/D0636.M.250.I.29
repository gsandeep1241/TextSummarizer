In one of General Motors' sprawling auto parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour producing instrument panels and steering wheels for GM cars and trucks.
GM's new strategy, and particularly 's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last settled a strike of nearly two s at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich.
UAW officials were studying 's announcement and had no immediate reaction.
The transfer of production to Mexico and other countries has become a focus of the United Automobile Workers strike against GM, which began at a stamping plant in Flint and at the Delphi East factory.
But in the late 1970s, in response to an earlier law encouraging foreign manufacturers to produce goods here for export tax-free, GM changed strategy.
Now, Delphi's Mexican plants basically turn out parts once produced in the United States.
Such a settlement could have major implications for GM In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits from the automaker, not the subsidiary.
But the Oshawa workers are among the most militant in the North American auto industry.
The UAW maintained the strikes were allowable under the contract because they concerned health and safety issues.
