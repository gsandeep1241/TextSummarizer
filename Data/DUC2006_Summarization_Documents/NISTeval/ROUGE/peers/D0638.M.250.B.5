Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year.
(AP) -- NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
Spacecraft Galileo will close in on Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede early Thursday morning to gather the most detailed information ever obtained about the icy satellite, according to a NASA report.
Equipped with 10 scientific instruments, Galileo, the 2.5-ton unmanned probe launched in October 1989, will fly only 840 kilometers above Ganymede's surface at 2:29 a.m.
As part of an extended mission, Galileo's instruments are studying the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic properties of Io, Jupiter's innermost large moon and the only known actively volcanic solar system object besides Earth.
The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled.
The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
The Jupiter's volcano-pocked moon Io has been found by the Galileo spacecraft to have a giant iron core that takes up half its diameter, reported the
