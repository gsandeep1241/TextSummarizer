In hot weather, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is more likely.
This summer has been unusual, with a growing La Nina sharing the ocean with remnants of the strongest El Nino on record.
Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _ with changes in winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow east in an El Nino or spreading cool water west in a La Nina.
La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South.
The shift brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to Indonesia in August after a long drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon.
The extreme weather is just the opposite of the extremes those areas suffered during the 1997-98 El Nino.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects wind and temperature patterns.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino
