President Boris Yeltsin announced that Russian forces would halt their offensive in rebel Chechnya from midnight and start a partial withdrawal from some areas, but warned that Chechen separatist fighters would be hit hard if they stage terrorist attacks.
He made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels.
Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said Friday the government is tightening security on the border with Chechnya, to guard against possible terrorist attacks.
Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets.
An estimated 100,000 Chechens crowded the border crossing between Chechnya and the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia on Saturday.
Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to cross into Chechnya.
Only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks.
Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there.
The Defense Ministry believes that Chechen rebels intend to let federal troops into Chechnya and launch large scale retribution actions while staging subversive and terrorist acts in the three Russian border regions of Daghestan, Stavropol and Krasnodar.
The rebels are retreating from the Gudermes and Sunzha districts to mountainous areas in Chechnya under attacks from the federal troops.
