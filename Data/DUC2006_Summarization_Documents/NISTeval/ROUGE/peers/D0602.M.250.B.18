The two professors said they examined 11 swimmers, all of whom were witnesses in the trial.
The six were charged with causing bodily harm by administering performance-enhancing drugs to young swimmers without informing the athletes or their parents.
Binus, 59, admitted administering anabolic steroids, but insisted in court testimony that the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill effects.
One had heavy facial hair that was either caused or worsened by taking anabolic steroids, they said.
Two women were diagnosed with liver damage, they said, and another had a liver tumor that could be traced back to taking a combination of contraceptive pills and steroids for eight years.
Horst Luebbert, a professor of clinical gynecology, cautioned, however that while the health damage was ``with all probability'' linked to doping, ``we can't offer (absolute) security.'' The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of drugs.
The International Olympic Committee last week approved testing for erythropoietin, or EPO, a synthetic version of a naturally-occurring hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells and is believed to be widely used in such endurance sports as distance running, cycling, swimming and rowing.
