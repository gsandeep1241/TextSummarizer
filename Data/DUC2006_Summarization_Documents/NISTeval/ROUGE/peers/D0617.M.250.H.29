U.S. investigators are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder from the ocean depths where the Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed October 31.
All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
A submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket, bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two "Black Boxes", was retrieved early and now is under analysis by experts of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board in Washington.
Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew fight or pilot suicide.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
But they do not single out a particular cause of the crash and do not include any analysis.
The FAA estimates that the plane hit the water at about 1:51 a.m., four minutes after its last transmission.
That led to speculation that co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty may have deliberately crashed the plane.
