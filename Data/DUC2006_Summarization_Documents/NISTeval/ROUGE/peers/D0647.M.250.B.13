The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided to turn the boy over to his father at a meeting here, government officials said night.
Lazaro Gonzales, the great-uncle who has custody of the boy, emerged from his house in Miami and said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from the Miami family would go.
Turning Elian over to his father would settle the issue in the view of immigration officials.
There were unconfirmed reports that he might join in Reno's meeting with his Miami relatives via telephone.
Elian and his Miami relatives moved to O' Laughlin's home at mid-day in an effort to escape the tension surrounding the family's tiny Little Havana home.
The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
Elian was rescued at sea three days after the boy, his mother and 12 others left Cuba in a small motor boat.
Elian's father requested that his son be returned to him, touching off the battle for custody of the boy.
U.S. officials postponed a deadline for revoking the boy's custody status.
Justice Department officials warned that they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts to return Elian to his father.
