If true, that would fall within the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case.
Clinton's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case did not include oral sex.
Some Democrats have said that even if the worst is true _ that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury _ that is not necessarily an impeachable offense.
The vote was 417 to 0.
