The nation's big cities experienced the steepest decline in their crime rate, with a 5 percent drop, while suburban counties saw a decrease of 4 percent, and rural areas were down 1 percent.
WASHINGTON The rate of violent crime in the United States continued a downward trend in 1999, with drop last year representing one of the largest decreases in decades.
The police and prosecutors in some upstate areas have said they fear that as New York City's crime rate drops, criminals move northward, where drugs fetch higher prices.
Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are influencing the nation's crime rate.
Results of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, begun in 1972, show that property crime rates continue a 25-year downward trend.
"It's definitely continues the trend of good news about crime," said James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice.
The National Institute of Justice, in a study of the national "three strike" movement, also says that it is still too early to tell whether California's tougher sentencing law is having any substantial impact on crime rates, although it has had a major effect on the state's prison capacity and criminal court caseloads.
Within a year, the state hopes to institute a similar data-sharing system among 10 counties, with the hope that this will help the police agencies map county-to-county trends, share resources and confront crime more effectively.
