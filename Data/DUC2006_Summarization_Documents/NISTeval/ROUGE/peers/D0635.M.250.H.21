HOUSTON _ George W. Bush had not quite finished his second week as governor of Texas in 1995 when the first death penalty cases of his administration landed on his desk.
In his five years as governor, Bush has presided over the executions of 111 men and one woman, far more than any other governor in any other state since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
The public has frequently seen an affable George W. Bush or a serious George W. Bush.
Bush granted a 30-day reprieve for McGinn in June -- the only reprieve he has granted as governor -- so that further DNA testing could be done.
They want to embarrass Bush and halt capital punishment by exposing flaws in the Texas system.
"With Mr. Bush as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, capital punishment in Texas is under heightened scrutiny," says The New York Times.
"Governor Bush has been a very receptive and reasonable governor when it comes to issues of crime and criminal justice," said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, the Houston-based victims group.
"These are life and death decisions, and Governor Bush makes them based on principle".

Since Bush became governor in 1995, the state has executed 143 people, including 32 this year.
Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor has only limited power to stop an execution.
Bush has spared only one condemned inmate since becoming governor in 1995.
