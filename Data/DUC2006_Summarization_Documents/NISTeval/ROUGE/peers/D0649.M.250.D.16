''I think that it would be offered to the public even before the election,'' Putin said on a recent trip, then quickly added: ''Surely, before the election.'' Analysts said that Putin, a dour and colorless figure, would be a tough sell for the Russian electorate.
With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov finished in second place with a stronger-than-expected 29 percent, and liberal Gregory Yavlinsky was third with 6 percent.
Prior to the 1996 presidential election, Putin led, on Sobchak's orders, the St. Petersburg NDR (``Our Home Is Russia'') office.
The announcement comes 10 weeks before the March 26 presidential election, which Putin is heavily favored to win.
Putin, who was born on October 7, 1952 in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), was elected in the March 26 presidential election with a vote of about 53 percent.
Under the Russian constitution, a new presidential election must be held within 90 days following the early resignation of a sitting president.
Putin made the remarks in an open letter to the voters about his program for the upcoming presidential election.
His trip, heavily covered by Russian state media, was also a campaign swing.
It came a day after the Central Elections Commission completed the registration of candidates for the March 26 presidential election.
``I agreed at once,'' Putin recalls in an interview.
