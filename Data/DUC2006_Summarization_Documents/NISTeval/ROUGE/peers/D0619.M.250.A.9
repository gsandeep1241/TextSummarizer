But for now it is refreshing to listen to the voice of an important preacher in the Republican Party, Rich Tafel, an ordained American Baptist minister and the head of the national gay Log Cabin Republicans.
As is the case with other contentious social issues such as abortion, the gay rights issue is something of a thorn in the side of Republicans and their presidential hopeful, Texas Gov. So it is in Dallas this weekend that about 200 Log Cabin Republicans from around the country will gather for the group's national convention, challenging the GOP to come to terms with the gays and lesbians in their own ideological family.
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said Monday the two-term governor looks forward to his invitation-only meeting with 13 gay Republicans, including rank-and-file members of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national organization of gay Republicans.
The leaflet points out that Ebner is gay, highlights his membership in the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and notes his support for expanding the state's anti-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation.
But he does need to move more on some gay political issues,'' said Steve Labinski, who heads the Texas branch of the Log Cabin Republicans.
``This bill is offensive, and I think any fair-minded individual will find this bill to be offensive,'' said Steve Labinski, president of Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, which advocates equal treatment of homosexuals in the GOP.
