Republicans have long wanted to give low income working people a greater share of subsidized housing, while Democrats wanted to favor the poorest of the poor, who have no resources to obtain shelter at market rates.
Unlike public housing residents, who live in a closed community, people who receive the vouchers are dispersed throughout the private housing market.
In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to produce and maintain low income rental housing with the help of government subsides.
Today's predicament in housing differs significantly from that of the 1980s, when the state's housing market experienced a similar upturn, housing advocates say.
The report says, the brisk housing market has driven rent prices upward, causing problems for the working poor and those newly off of welfare.
Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low income people pay about 30% of their income as rent.
The trust, which the Massachusetts Democrat said can be funded by annual revenues of the Federal Housing Administration, would be used to help create rental housing for low and moderate income families, and to expand elderly housing and homeownership programs across the nation.
Housing and Urban Development officials said incomes for average Americans are growing at a rate roughly 30% greater than incomes for the poorest Americans.
Low income housing was becoming less available because it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is being knocked down.
