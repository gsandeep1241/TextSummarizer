Perjury charges, when they are brought at all, arise in conjunction with other crimes.
``The way to make a perjury case is to ask the question 10 different ways,'' said Brosnahan, who has called in linguistics professors to aid his defense of clients charged with perjury.
Defenders of President Clinton have argued that his accusers are overzealous in saying he should be impeached or subject to criminal charges on the grounds that he committed perjury when he denied in a civil deposition that he had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The review of perjury cases also shows that, while lies about sex are rarely the subject of perjury prosecutions, there are precedents that come quite close to the allegations against Clinton.
The reality is that House members can vote for impeachment even if they don't think Clinton committed perjury in the legal sense, just as they can vote against impeachment even if they think Clinton did commit perjury.
While Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr has suggested there are several instances of possible perjury, the main question is whether Clinton lied under oath when he said he did not have sex with Lewinsky.
Republicans who believe that Clinton committed perjury noted that Clinton did engage in sexual activities with Lewinsky that were included in the definition.
After the conviction on two counts of perjury, the House passed three articles of impeachment, charging the judge with making false and misleading statements to the grand jury and to federal agents.
