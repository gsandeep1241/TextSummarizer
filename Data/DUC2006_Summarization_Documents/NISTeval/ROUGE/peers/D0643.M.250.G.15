Studies have disagreed on whether the warming would produce the El-Nino-like Pacific surface temperatures.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects wind and temperature patterns.
La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west.
`It's really a question at this point: Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers''? he said.
`El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time,'' said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate Prediction Center.
That might make it possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in years without a big El Nino.
The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events.
"If we can predict a change in the weather, such as when El Nino cycles around, we could have all the interventions in place before the weather changes.".
Overall the El Nino weather phenomenon of 1997-98 produced more benefits than destruction for the United States.
"It has become imperative in the backdrop of past performance of El Nino," the weather expert said.
The extreme weather is just the opposite of the extremes those areas suffered during the 1997-98 El Nino.
