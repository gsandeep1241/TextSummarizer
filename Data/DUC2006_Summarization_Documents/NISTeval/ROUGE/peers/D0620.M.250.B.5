WASHINGTON -- Despite a well-publicized spate of school shootings, the number of students expelled for bringing a gun to a public school dropped nationally in the 1997-98 school year, the U.S. Education Department reported Tuesday.
Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as requiring students to wear school uniforms.
Fort Bend doesn't have metal detectors in its schools but does have district police officers at middle and high school campuses, video surveillance cameras in some schools and a student crime-stopper number to report incidents to administrators.
HOUSTON -- To prevent school violence, suburban and rural school districts should consider some measures used by their urban counterparts, experts and educators say.
There were bomb threats in New York area schools after the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School, but no serious incidents were reported.
A bomb was found near the school campus Thursday after school officials and parents gathered to discuss the alleged plot by the four students at the school.
Ronald Stephens of the California-based National School Safety Center told a House subcommittee after the Jonesboro shootings: ``It should not require an act of courage for parents to send their children to school.'' Riley said school efforts to counter violence are paying off and students are getting the message that guns have no place in school.
Unless local school parent councils vote otherwise, every public school student in the state next year could be wearing clothes to school most wouldn't be caught dead in once they get home.
