Judging from the agitation in the state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded: - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools.
"We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really would be a waste of time".
Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan.
, an evolution supporter, says Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the facts of evolution.
It is by far the biggest failure of science education from top to bottom".
The challenges to teaching evolution have changed, said Dr. Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, which monitors the teaching of creationism in schools and communities nationwide.
Drawing on the deep resources of "creation science" advocacy groups, American fundamentalists are arming themselves with the latest books challenging details of Darwinian theory, getting elected to majority positions on school boards and learning ways to word curriculums so that creationism and evolution get equal respect.
But Charles Darwin's theory still faces challenges in the nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists, state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject evolution.
