President Bill Clinton Thursday condemned terrorist bomb attacks at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and vowed to find the bombers and bring them to justice.
WASHINGTON - Federal law enforcement officials said Saturday that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman who has vowed to wage a holy war against the United States, to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
A suspect in the recent bombing of the U. S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was arrested by Pakistani authorities and handed over to Kenya, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.
Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the hundreds of Kenyan victims of the embassy bombing, but also wary that a trial for an attack on a U.S. target in Kenya might invite new terrorist assaults on Kenyan targets.
Nearly simultaneous bombings at U. S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug. 7 killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 5, 500 people.
Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried into the embassy compound on a water tanker truck that periodically distributed water to the embassy and homes in the residential neighborhood.
A U.S. federal indictment alleges that four followers of Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden plotted a far-reaching terrorist campaign to kill Americans, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
