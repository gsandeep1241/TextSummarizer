In 1998, Reeves, despite her argument that she had no intention of taking anything aimed at improperly aiding her performance, became the first female tennis player ever to have tested positive for steroids.
The cost to the three tennis organizations is approximately $500,000 per year, and so far, the only other player found guilty of using steroids is the 23 year old Truyol.
In his book, The Steroids Game, Penn State professor Charles Yesalis estimates the use of steroids among female college athletes at 5% in swimming, 6% in basketball and 10% in track and field.
In 1999, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13% of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40% of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body building, primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and because so many athletes endorse its use.
Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage.
Whether trying to reach stardom in high school sports, working to achieve a fashionable lean but muscular look or suffering from a deep psychological disorder, teen age girls are using illegal anabolic steroids in sharply increasing numbers.
Other indications, including the results of a small study in Oregon, are that steroid use among both girls and boys is increasing unabated.
