While nowadays, more children are adopted each year from Russia and China, South Korea's system remains the model for international adoptions, and there are more than 100,000 adopted Koreans in the United States.
The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys released a statement saying the measure ''holds tremendous potential to correct some significantly flawed international adoption practices.'' In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to implement the treaty, the measure also includes guidelines for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that work internationally.
Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call the ``Ovarian Olympics.'' A draft of the Adoption Law has relaxed restrictions in many aspects for Chinese and foreigners who apply for adoptions, according to a member of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, Wan Shaofen, who was debating the draft.
The restrictions were originally intended to make sure Chinese families did not orchestrate adoptions to circumvent the one-child limit.
For the old-line agencies, ``there are Catch-22's everywhere,'' said Pierce of the National Council for Adoption.
The bill allows foreign adoption agencies to operate in Russia only after their country signs an agreement with Russia setting out the rules.
The amended version of the bill contained no time limit for the prospective international agreements to be signed, meaning pending adoptions will not be stalled by the measure.
