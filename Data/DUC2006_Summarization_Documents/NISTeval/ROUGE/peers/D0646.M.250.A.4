But a review of more than 100 perjury cases in state and federal courts, and statistics on the number of perjury prosecutions brought around the country, show that people are prosecuted in America for what might be called small lies more regularly than the Clinton defenders have suggested.
One statistic on perjury prosecutions has been widely circulated since the president's supporters began arguing that perjury was little more than a technicality seized upon by the president's enemies : Of 49, 655 cases filed by federal prosecutors last year, only 87 were for perjury.
And even in the federal system, prison officials said in October that 115 people were serving sentences for perjury in federal prisons alone.
The review of perjury cases also shows that, while lies about sex are rarely the subject of perjury prosecutions, there are precedents that come quite close to the allegations against Clinton.
precedents " No Democrat has alleged that perjury is not a serious legal matter, only that perjury in these circumstances, given the underlying allegations against the president, does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense, " said James Jordan, a spokesman for committee Democrats.
" In the typical straightforward and blunt way that he's famous for, I ' m sure he 'll tell the committee that perjury is perjury is perjury, " Parks said.
In addition to perjury, federal law also prohibits making false statements on federal forms or to federal officers such as FBI agents.
