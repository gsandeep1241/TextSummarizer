"Normally, all submarines go to sea equipped for war." The failures were blamed on a strong undercurrent and poor visibility.
More than 20 ships and other vessels are participating in the rescue operation.
"The Kursk is an ocean submarine, whose systems function perfectly at great depths." The presidents were at the world leaders' meeting at the United Nations.
The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "Granite" cruise missiles.
It sank in international waters, about 35 miles from the coast.
The sub fell to the seabed from a depth of 20 meters.
No explanation was given for why the information was only made public on Monday.
Besides torpedoes, it normally carries 24 missiles intended to destroy ships.
Attempts to simulate the third situation at a testing ground have so far failed.
The evacuation of the 116-man crew of "Kursk" begun Tuesday afternoon.
The navy press office could not be reached for comment Monday night.
Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts to dock with the Kursk overnight.
The "Kursk", with a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and able to dive to an depth of up to 500 meters, was commissioned for the Russian navy in 1995.
Pressure within the vessel must be low enough to provide for survival.
Currently, Britain and Norway are sending personnel to the accident site.
The Kursk is designed to carry 24 nuclear armed cruise missiles designed to knock out large surface vessels such as aircraft carriers.
