WASHINGTON (AP) -- New regulations that will make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically sensitive areas.
The Corps completed a 172-page overhaul of its wetlands regulations this week and is ready to issue the new requirements, according to government and private sources.
The Corps scheduled a news conference on the regulations for Monday.
But sources familiar with the regulations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today final release may be delayed because of some technical changes.
According to sources who have seen the new regulations, the Corps will require developers to obtain specific permits for projects affecting at least a half-acre of wetlands, compared to three acres under current regulations.
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.
(AP) - The Army Corps of Engineers tightened its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large project.
Under the Clean Water Act, the corps has jurisdiction over any project that involves the discharge of fill or dredged material into waterways, which include rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands.
''I don't want to say there was a full consensus, but there was a general feeling in New York, even in some towns that are more pro-development, that people wanted more protection in the New York City watershed,'' said Joe Seebode, chief of the district's regulatory branch.
