After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
For much of the past week, investigators and mourning families have waited as foul weather and winds caused delays in the search for the recorders.
Hall said the retrieval of the first recorder _ another, the cockpit voice recorder, remains missing on the sea floor _ could provide key insights into the crash.
An electrical or computer problem would cause those screens to go blank, or could even result in erroneous flight data to be displayed, Gellert said.
That would explain why it kept working longer, assuming an electrical problem caused the autopilot to disconnect.
Primarily because authorities have introduced the possibility that a human _ not some mechanical failure _ caused the crash.
Under that theoretical line of reasoning, if co-pilot Gamil El Batouty really did cause the crash, he could have done so for political rather than personal reasons.
Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew fight or pilot suicide.
Investigators doubt that the plane crash, which resulted in the death of all 217 aboard, may have been caused by a criminal act.
The Egyptian side has strongly opposed the speculations, stressing technical failure might cause the tragedy.
