ULAN BATOR, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain have both pledged to continue their support for Mongolia's foreign policy and its political and economic reforms, Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here Monday.
The two countries also promised to continue humanitarian aid to Mongolia and expressed appreciation of and backing for its self-declared nuclear-free status, Ochirbat said in an interview with the newspaper People's Right.
Mongolia's reforms, aimed at transforming its centrally-planned economy into a market-oriented one, have won support from France and Britain since they were launched in 1990, said Ochirbat, shortly after his return from his first visit to the two countries.
The two European countries also agreed to strengthen their relations with Mongolia and increase economic and trade contacts, he added.
