The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender''.
Among those arrested by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong police was Cheung's wife, who was in one of the houses raided, Television Broadcast reported.
Because Hong Kong is now part of China, international agreements on the transfer of criminal suspects do not cover such cross-border crimes _ even though the outcome of cases can been vastly different under the two legal systems.
HONG KONG (AP) _ As a reputed local crime boss fights his death sentence in China, reports Thursday said Hong Kong officials had previously asked mainland counterparts to consider sparing the lives of territory residents convicted of capital offenses in China.
The Hong Kong government has said it was forwarding to China clemency pleas for Cheung and one of his gang members on behalf of their families.
Zhang Fusen, head of the Chinese delegation, told the fifth session of the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) that China will participate in United Nations activities in crime prevention and criminal justice.
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times.
Zhang said that China amended its Criminal Law recently to enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering, terrorist crime, trafficking of illegal immigrants and environment-related crimes.
