Other officials now say it is unclear that Empta was actually produced at the plant, but insisted that the soil sample proved the factory's complicity in making VX.
The diplomats and the former government official said it was not absolutely clear at which of several plants the Iraqis were working on chemical weapons or their precursors.

Just because you identify a chemical agent for commercial uses, that does not mean anyone makes it, the official said.
