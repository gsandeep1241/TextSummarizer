Jewish settlements is one of the outstanding obstacles that block the progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, that has been halted since Israeli construction of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in early 1997.
Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest enemy of the peace process.
But he said the strategic cooperation also has another aspect, that is, to look for ways to move forward the stalled peace process.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who took office in July with a pledge to revive the stalled peace process, said that he will neither build new Jewish settlements nor dismantle existing ones.
Commenting on this issue, President Ezer Weizman said that the dismantlement of the illegal encampments is necessary and the result could help push the peace process forward.
Abourudeneh made the remarks in the West Bank city of Ramallah after a meeting between Arafat and visiting Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, during which the two leaders discussed the latest development in the peace process.
A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said the prime minister assured Muasher that Israel was still committed to the Middle East peace process.
Arafat's call came a day ahead of the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian talks on further implementing the interim agreement.
The talks signaled the continuation of the peace process following Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron last month.
