Fleshing out proposals for fiscal 2000 that were sketched in his Jan. 19 State of the Union address, Clinton urged the Republican-led Congress to begin devoting the projected $4.4 trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years to ``progressive but prudent'' investments to enable Americans in their 20s and 30s to meet the ``challenges of their times... unburdened by the unfinished business of the 20th century''.
Clinton told an invited audience in the East Room of the White House that it is ``profoundly important'' that Americans ``see this budget not just as the budget that saves Social Security and Medicare, but the budget that ensures for young Americans the same chance... to meet the challenges that they will have to face that we don't know yet''.
Clinton, citing the risk that the global financial crisis might slam into the robust American economy, said reducing the long-term financial burdens facing younger Americans will help bolster the economy.
Part of the reason for the anticipated huge budget surpluses _ $5.9 trillion over the next 15 years by one administration measure _ is the failure of congressional and White House analysts to predict the feverish growth of the economy when compiling the federal budgets over the last six years.
The president has proposed using 62 percent of the overall budget surplus over the next 15 years _ approximately the portion of the surplus attributable to an excess in payroll taxes over retirement benefits _ to shore up Social Security.
