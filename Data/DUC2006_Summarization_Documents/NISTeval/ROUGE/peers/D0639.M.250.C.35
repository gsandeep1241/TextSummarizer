Iraq strongly denies U.S. intelligence charges that it worked with Sudanese scientists at a Khartoum plant to build chemical weapons projects, the Iraqi ambassador said Tuesday.
The Dutch government banned a shipment of chemicals to Sudan earlier this year because of fears they might be used to make nerve gas, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
The Security Council held preliminary discussions Monday on an Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding a U.N. investigation into U.S. claims that a Sudanese factory it bombed last month was making chemical weapons.
Council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said he had received a letter from Lebanese Ambassador Samir Moubarak, the current head of the informal group of Arab states, known as the Arab Group, with a copy of the draft resolution in it.
The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary because U.S. intelligence showed the El Shifa plant produced chemical weapons.
High-ranking officials were not immediately notified and alarms were ignored during a tiny leak of dangerous nerve gas at the Army's chemical-weapons incinerator in May, according to a report by the plant's operators.
Two administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in the weeks leading up to last Thursday's strike, the United States had obtained a sample of a critical chemical used in the making of VX, a deadly nerve agent.
Preliminary French and Swiss test results found no traces of VX.
