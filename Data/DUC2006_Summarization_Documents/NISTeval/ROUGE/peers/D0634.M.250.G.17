NATCHEE, Wash. _ Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon . Salmon spawn throughout the Pacific Northwest, so any effort to save them will have to be regional in scope . Washington agreed last June to restrict the recreational catch of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British Columbia, and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound for the Stuart River . The decline of Snake River salmon has been sharp since the lower Snake River dams went up in the 1960s and 1970s.
The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest . The United States and Canada signed an agreement on Wednesday aimed at protecting and building up dwindling Pacific salmon supplies . Others announce that the United States and Canada agree on an urgent plan to rescue salmon runs in Washington, Oregon and British Columbia . But with the river ' s coho salmon already declared extinct, and every other species of Snake River salmon and steelhead now listed under the Endangered Species Act, the once-unthinkable idea of breaching the dams has emerged in several federal studies as the action with the best chance of restoring healthy salmon runs .
