Tuesday's flight to New York, with 33 of the 100 seats filled, was more than two hours late departing.
On Saturday, emergency services were out on the runway to attend to the landing of a Concorde at Heathrow after a report of a loud bang in an engine.
Some 100 technicians transported the wreckage to a site at Dugny near Le Bourget airport, north of Paris, where it will be examined.
Forty-four members of the French national police and three judicial experts are participating in the inquiry.
