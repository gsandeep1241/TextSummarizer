Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen separatists, issued Monday a tough statement to Russian authorities and the military, but Yastrzhembsky said it's ``nothing new''.
The separatist leader also said that if the Russian authorities present evidence showing that Chechen people have something to do with the bombings of apartment houses in Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buynaksk, he is prepared to hand over the suspects to the courts ``under the control of international organizations.'' Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency reported.
Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the Chechen republic and the North Caucuses... and consistently implement it,'' news agencies said.
About 50 persons have been detained in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, eight of whom may have taken part in the suicide bombing in the city of Argun, 10 kilometers southeast of the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky on Chechnya told an interview in Moscow Wednesday.
He said the militants were planning ''a number of terrorist acts on the territory of Chechnya'' at the end of the month, but for the moment were concentrating on ''quick attacks'' on Russian checkpoints.
