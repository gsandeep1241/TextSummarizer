The West Nile virus -- never before recorded in the Western Hemisphere -- probably entered the United States in infected birds.
Last summer an outbreak of the West Nile virus killed seven people in Queens, N.Y., and sickened more than 60 others.
Hundreds of crows died as well.
Every park ranger and public health specialist on the East Coast has been on alert since.
The West Nile virus has triggered a psychological reaction all its own, tapping into some of our most primitive fears.
High doses of statistics don't seem to stop the fear epidemic.
This virus scares not just because it's exotic and new, but because many feel so helpless to fight it.
HACKENSACK, N.J.
(AP) -- An 82-year-old New Jersey man has become the first person in the United States this year to die of the West Nile virus, Gov. Christie Whitman said Wednesday.
The West Nile virus is commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East.
Its appearance in the New York area last year was the first in the Western Hemisphere, prompting a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes.
No one knows which birds carry the virus, which is similar to the West Nile virus of Africa.
Humans are infected through mosquitoes that have fed from the blood of infected birds.
