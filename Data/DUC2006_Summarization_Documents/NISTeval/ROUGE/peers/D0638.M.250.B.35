Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself, researchers say.
More than 30 volcanoes spew lava, an eerie blue light erupts from torrid fountains and a natural dynamo generates more electricity than every power plant in America combined.
New photos from the Galileo satellite show lava glowing in red pools, scattered like an angry rash across the face of Io.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
Galileo measured Europa's magnetic fields in an effort to detect disturbances from a suspected liquid ocean beneath the moon's icy crust.
Ever since a Voyager spacecraft flew by Europa in 1979, scientists have entertained the intriguing possibility of a global ocean below its surface.
The observations, some researchers said, could mean that some planetesimals rained down on the forming planet from the colder, outer reaches of the solar system that are farther from the warmth of the sun.
Other planetary scientists suggested that the results imply that the whirling disk of dust, gas and rock in the young solar system, called the solar nebula, simply shaded the sun's light more than expected in standard theories.
