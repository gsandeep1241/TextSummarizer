The vast warm ocean that probably lies beneath the iceberg-studded crust of Europa is equally salty too, scientists now say.
A team of researchers investigating the powerful magnetic field that pulsates around giant Jupiter reported Wednesday that a sophisticated instrument aboard their spacecraft has detected effects on the two Jovian moons that can best be explained by the existence of salty water conducting electricity beneath the mysterious satellites.
``Until now, we thought Callisto was a dead and boring moon, just a hunk of rock and ice,'' said space physicist Margaret Kivelson of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has been using Galileo's magnetometer to measure electric currents flowing from Jupiter for nearly three years.
``The new data certainly suggest that something is hidden below Callisto's surface, and that something may well be a salty ocean,''she said.
As for Jupiter's moon Europa, images of icebergs on the icy crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft after it reached the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow and brown matter that many scientists argue must indicate the presence of organic matter _ the possible precursors of life _ in a warm ocean miles beneath the ice.
On Europa, a moon that races through dim sunlight in an orbit that takes it around Jupiter every three and a half days, there appears to be enough heat and water to support forms of life already found in some of the Earth's more inhospitable places.
Within five years, the
