What is the perjury case against president Clinton.
Perjury is a punishable crime and that's no lie Washington.
The first two impeachment articles that the House will debate Thursday charge President Clinton with perjury in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
Some courts have gone out of their way to say that perjury in civil cases is as important as perjury in any other testimony.
But Republicans who believe that Clinton committed perjury noted that Clinton did engage in sexual activities with Lewinsky that were included in the definition.
The president lawyer David Kendall has said that ``no prosecutor in the United States would bring a perjury prosecution on the basis of the kinds of questions Clinton was asked about Clinton sex life in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
After the conviction on two counts of perjury the House passed three articles of impeachment charging the judge with making false and misleading statements to the grand jury and to federal agents.
Still some Democrats have said that even if the worst is true _ that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury _ that is not necessarily an impeachable offense.
On the question of whether Lewinsky discussed Lewinsky possible testimony in the Jones case with Lewinsky or Vernon Jordan White House lawyers argue that Starr and Republicans have pinpointed only the answers that suggest perjury by Clinton.
And even in the federal system prison officials said in October that 115 people were serving sentences for perjury in federal prisons alone..
