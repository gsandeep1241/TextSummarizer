Here's the U.S. House of Representatives on the verge of all but endorsing job discrimination against gays and lesbians by disallowing an order forbidding that.
``This message is not emanating from the GOP,'' Owens said.
``It's not a Democrat or a Republican issue,'' Bilbray said.
The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992, when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed squarely at homosexuals.
Bush, so far the run-away favorite in the Republican field, has said he would have no qualms about hiring gays.
Besides his hate-crimes and anti-gay-adoption positions, Bush, as governor, has refused to support gay marriages.
In contrast to GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who has thus far declined the group's invitation, McCain sat down with members of the Log Cabin Republicans last month and said that he would work to end discrimination, and that appears to be enough for many gay Republicans, particularly when the senator's position is compared with those of other presidential candidates.
AUSTIN, Texas _ Members of one minority group _ gays and lesbians _ still aren't sure whether Bush's emphasis on inclusiveness includes them.
As the country becomes increasingly tolerant of homosexuality, Bush's lukewarm attitude may alienate heterosexual voters as well, Sherrill said.
AUSTIN, Texas _ Bush.
