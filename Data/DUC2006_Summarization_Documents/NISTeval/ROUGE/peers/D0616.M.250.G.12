The latest report shows that the casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached over 100 said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks.
Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
Militants were planning a number of terrorist acts on the territory of Chechnya at the end of the month but for the moment were concentrating on quick attacks on Russian checkpoints.
Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday presidential elections the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of Chechnya capital of Grozny then pulled back to about three miles inside the border.
They can no longer fight the way they did three or four months ago but they have carried out are carrying out.
