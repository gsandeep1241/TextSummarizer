La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
But it also produced an exceptionally mild winter in most of the Northern states and blocked Atlantic Coast hurricanes.
La Nina refers to a large, unusually cold pool of water in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that develops every several years, and influences weather patterns around the world.
National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina - a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino's - would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
The pool of cold Pacific water that is the heart of La Nina has shrunk to one-fourth the size it was in May, even as warm water left over from El Nino remains.
Despite predictions that La Nina would bring Los Angeles a dry winter and possibly worsen the fire season, the weather phenomenon now appears to be losing strength.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
Oklahoma's catastrophic tornadoes were influenced by La Nina, the weather phenomenon 5,000 miles west of the prairie in the Pacific Ocean.
John Miller told The Associated Press that the forecast was a conservative prediction that discounted
