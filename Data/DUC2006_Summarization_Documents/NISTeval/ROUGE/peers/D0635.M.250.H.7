The major change under Bush, Gaither said, was switching the main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison system in which punishment is emphasized.
Gov. W. Bush gets criticized for his hands-off approach to state executions, but state law leaves little room for governors to act in these life-and-death decisions.
In the end, Bush said he agreed with the parole board's vote in favor of Graham's execution.
He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.
The cocky Gov. who makes flippant comments shows up on days when he is feeling especially good about himself, such as right before his inauguration to a second term in office.
But death penalty opponents contend that Bush's record-setting embrace of capital punishment may yet be a negative factor for him in the 2000 election.
By contrast, Minnesota, with the lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people.
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said Bush weakens his credibility when he insists that all 134 inmates executed on his watch have been guilty.
Yet the case also affords Bush a chance to speak in a moderate voice on the death penalty without seeming to pander, because the case involves some understandable questions of evidence that have drawn national attention.
But as he campaigns for president, his death penalty record offers insight into his distinct views of mercy and justice.
