Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from Parti Quebecois and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his resignation after the October-30 referendum on Quebec independence was defeated.
The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from the country.
But Quebec insists that any decision on independence must be made only by the people of Quebec.
The last word belongs to Quebec democracy, to the Quebec people, " declared Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard.
Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30-year-fight for independence was a risky strategy for the federal government because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
MONTREAL - With popular support for Quebec's independence in remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada made a bold gamble with his country's future last week, introducing legislation that lays out Canada's first road map for national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will never follow it.
The Clarity Bill immediately met with a counter-attack from Quebec separatists who unveiled legislation in Quebec City reaffirming their right to declare independence in the fashion it sees fit.
