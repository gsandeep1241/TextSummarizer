The movie debuts May 19.
Uh huh.
A week after the new Star Wars blockbuster opened in the United States, pirated copies have already hit store shelves in Hong Kong and Macau.
The ``Star Wars'' prequel is setting box-office records, but it is not alone.
``Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace'' was North America's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, bringing in $64.8 million for a total gross of $205 million in a record 13 days.
Starting April 30, Denver will host the Lucasfilm Ltd.-sanctioned ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a three-day fan festival at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum with ``Phantom Menace'' sneak peeks, appearances by many of the film's stars, including young Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a.
Darth Vader), and a marketplace hawking merchandise from all the ``Star Wars'' films.
Recently, Moritz Minzlaff, an 18-year-old German college student in Karlsruhe, south of Heidelberg, posted an Internet message begging fellow foreign ``Star Wars'' fans to join him in traveling to the United States to see ``Phantom Menace'' in May (opening dates outside North America start in June).
It looks like The Force is with the fans: United Artists Theaters executive vice president Mike Pade believes the deal is ``99.9 percent done'' with film distributor Twentieth Century Fox to book ``Episode I'' at the Coronet.
Its success, along with that of ``Jaws,'' is said to have finished off a certain kind of movie forever.
