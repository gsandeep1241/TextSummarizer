But the worldwide climate has changed significantly, most scientists concur.
Air temperatures have risen between 0.7 and 1.4 degrees in the past 100 years, and new data show ocean warming down to depths of nearly 10,000 feet.
``You tell me: Does the climate change dramatically as you go the five miles over the Rio Grande''? he asked.
At the speed the climate is now changing, scientists predict the world will soon be warmer than at any time in the last 10,000 years.

BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Wildlife Foundation of Argentina (WFA) on Friday called for the saving of forests and jungles, which are in danger because of the climate change.
He said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
Yet "for the nation as a whole, direct economic impacts are likely to be modest," concludes the report, which is based on computer models and historical data, and "American society would likely be able to adapt to most of the impacts."
