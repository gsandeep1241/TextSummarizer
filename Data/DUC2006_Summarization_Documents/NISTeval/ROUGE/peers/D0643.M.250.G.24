The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that dissipated in 1998.
Like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
The change in the weather was, of course, the work of El Nino.
The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature patterns.
La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
La Nina, Spanish for "little girl," is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west.
The current La Nina has persisted for nearly a year.
For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South.
Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form with changes in winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow east in an El Nino or spreading cool
