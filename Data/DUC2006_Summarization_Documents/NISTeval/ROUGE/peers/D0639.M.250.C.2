U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction before the 15-member Security Council will lift the sanctions.
The destruction of the weapons, including nerve gas, has been the focus of controversy for years with critics charging lax safety procedures at the U.S. Army's Tooele chemical weapons disposal facility.
Iraq has acknowledged that it once had sufficient precursor chemicals to make nearly 500 tons of VX, but claims that all its VX stocks have been destroyed.
Although the administration says the precursor has no other use than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical weapons, said another administration official, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
Workers there mixed pre-formulated chemicals into medicines, he said, and lacked the space to stockpile or manufacture other chemicals.
French tests have found traces of chemicals linked to the nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads, confirming earlier American test results, according to several weapons experts.
Some diplomats accuse the United States of also withholding information because its scientists did not find VX components or precursor chemicals on its second batch of samples, so as not to put its first tests into question.
The administration has been extremely reluctant to discuss Yugoslavia's ability to develop, produce and stockpile chemical weapons and other unconventional arms, or, as they are sometimes called, weapons of mass destruction.
