Ms. Chalker said.</line><line>&quot;Now they're hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as agencies without being licensed.&quot;</line><line>The frontier state for the adoption business is California.</line><line>The state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women.</line><line>Now, facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective parents and finding them professional help.</line><line>Facilitators operate in many states.</line><line>While their activities often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are generally too new or too few to prompt regulation.</line><line>But in California, legislation enacted last year to clarify their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of entrepreneurs.</line><line>Lil Snee, a facilitator in Los Gatos who co-founded an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are operating in the state.</line><line>For Ellen Roseman, a facilitator in San Anselmo, the main job is coaching prospective parents.</line><line>&quot;I make them read everything,&quot; she said.</line><line>&quot;It's like taking a college course.&quot;</line><line>Then she helps them piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies, often in other states.</line><line>She charges a flat fee of $3,450.</line><line>At a recent support-group meeting at Ms. Roseman's house on a winding lane in Marin County, casually dressed current and former clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false starts and disappointments.</line><line>&quot;I think it will get easier with time as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all,&quot;

to recruit adoptive families for children in foster care or to place disabled children who are costly to the state.</line><line>&quot;Say you have a kid who's HIV-positive in the hospital costing $1,000 a day,&quot; Pierce said.</line><line>&quot;To pay someone to find adoptive parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the public?&quot;</line><line>It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little choice.</line><line>Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American and biracial children.</line><line>&quot;Unfortunately, we had to create a separate program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward,&quot;

experts agree that the longer children remain in such institutions, the greater the emotional and developmental damage they incur.</line><line>Those interviewed, however, pointed out that every nation that allows its children to be adopted abroad has periodically revised its rules, especially during changes in government.</line><line>Most notably, that happened several times during the 1990s in China, which ranked at the top of &quot;sending&quot;

the third-highest source nation, South Korea (with 2,008 adoptees leaving last year), also runs operations that professionals believe is very clean.</line><line>So, if Russia is able to follow through on its promises, it would mean the lopsided majority of adoptions in the world will be done ethically and with a minimum of shady activity.</line><line>Almost 16,400 children from all nations, including some where such crimes as bribery, coercion, and baby theft are frequently reported, were adopted into the United States last year.</line><line>&quot;It certainly has the potential to slow down the process, but we believe that will be temporary.</line><line>And in the long run we're hoping it's a beneficial change because it makes the process more credible and provides assurances to prospective parents about the people they're working with, as well as to the Russian federation,&quot;
