Koplewicz, vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in New York City.</line><line>&quot;We have a critical need to conduct further studies of the long-term safety of these medications in children,&quot; he says.</line><line>Dr. Jerry Rushton, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor, says that clinicians simply know more about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past - and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of diagnoses and prescriptions.</line><line>According to Rushton, heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the 1990s, which provided evidence that identifiable, biologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old.</line><line>Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says Rushton, is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, which have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants.</line><line>They have been increasingly prescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children.</line><line>Does the rising use of medications indicate that rates of mental illnesses are actually increasing among children?</line><line>&quot;For over a decade there have been observations among teachers and pediatricians of increasing behavioral disturbances in children,&quot; says Dr. Barry Zuckerman, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine.</line><line>&quot;We don't know if it has to do with changing communities, family structure, TV video games or anything else, but there is a perception that behavioral disturbances are on the rise.&quot;</line><line>A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980.</line><line>In 1987, the APA redefined the criteria for diagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or impulsive behavior, and not necessarily both, as was previously the case.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="32"/></line><line>The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD diagnoses.</line><line>Figures released by the APA in May indicate that anywhere from 4</line><line>percent to 12 percent of all American children - some 2.5 million - are now thought to have the disorder, making it the most common pediatric mental illness in the United States.</line><line>And according to Zito, the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked directly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD.</line><line>Parents who consult a professional about their child's behavior will likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by clinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental health coverage is concerned.</line><line>&quot;There is no doubt that when it comes to mental illness, managed care interferes with diagnosis,&quot; says Dr. Alan Wachtel, a clinical associate professor at New York University Medical Center in New York City and author of &quot;The Attention Deficit Disorder Answer Book.&quot;</line><line>Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric specialists, limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions.</line><line>And, according to Koplewicz, most children are evaluated for mental illness not by child psychiatrists, but by pediatricians, many of whom have little training in mental health.</line><line>By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals, managed care companies are limiting the resources available to pediatricians, he says, which may add pressure to reach for the prescription pad.</line><line>Experts, including Koplewicz, say that children with mental illness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much higher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later on in life.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="22,3"/></line><line>If you are worried that your pediatrician cannot devote the time needed to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because of an overwhelming schedule, ask for a recommendation to a qualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment, which should include in-depth interviews with the child, parents and teachers, and a review of school records and family history.</line><line>Unfortunately, many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe medications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a way to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed care places on physicians, says Dr. Peter Jensen, the director of the Center for the Advancement of Children's Mental Health at the Columbia University School of Medicine in New York City.</line><line>But, he says, the decision to medicate should be based on the severity of the child's illness as determined by a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account the age and developmental maturity of the child.</line><line>In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, a team of researchers at six sites around the country, led by Jensen, followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their progress with various forms of treatment.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="4" sums="3,32,33,6"/></line><line>The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone.</line><line>In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD, such as depression or anxiety, combining medication with behavior therapy provided an advantage.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="5" sums="10,17,2,29,33"/></line><line>Because so few of these studies have been completed, a consensus among experts on the benefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to emerge.</line><line>Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="17,22"/></line><line>After the evaluation, he says, &quot;the critical thing is that you as a parent understand the diagnosis, as well as the benefits and risks of each treatment option under consideration.&quot;<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="2,3"/></line><line>(Charles W.
