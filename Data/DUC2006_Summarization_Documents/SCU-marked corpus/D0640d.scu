apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of feet to the sea floor near the Arctic Circle on Sunday, naval commander Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov said.</line><line>It had been taking part in naval exercises off the country's north coast.</line><line>Russian officials said the vessel was carrying no nuclear weapons and its nuclear reactors had been switched off, but the reports of

high,&quot; the navy chief said.</line><line>The Kursk was examined by a bell-shaped deep-water apparatus late Monday and a decision on how to conduct a rescue would likely be made Tuesday, according to Russian news reports.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="22"/></line><line>ITAR-Tass new agency said the outside inspection of the vessel did not support Adm.</line><line>Kuroyedov's

rushed to the area to help suggest ways to rescue the crew.</line><line>The condition of the crew was unknown.</line><line>The navy said at first that it was in radio contact with the submarine, but later admitted that there was only &quot;acoustic contact&quot; that could be the noise of crewmen pounding on the hull.</line><line>Navy officials declined to say how long the Kursk could remain submerged before it ran out of air for the crew.</line><line>Nuclear submarines depend on their reactors to replenish their air supplies.</line><line>The Kursk went down far above the Arctic Circle, but the sea was free of icebergs, said meteorological officials in nearby Norway.</line><line>Navy officials declined to say how far down the vessel was trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was some 450 feet down, a depth at which rescue would be difficult because of the crushing water pressure.</line><line>Various Russian reports said the submarine was 330 to 510 feet down.</line><line>White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the administration &quot;made clear to the Russians that any assistance we can offer is available.&quot;</line><line>He said national security adviser Sandy Berger reiterated this in a telephone conversation with Russian officials.</line><line>&quot;At this point there's been no request for our assistance,&quot; Lockhart added.</line><line>Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the Oscar-class submarine was not carrying nuclear weapons.</line><line>The Kursk is designed to carry 24 nuclear armed cruise missiles designed to knock out large surface vessels such as aircraft carriers.</line><line>But some Western military analysts were skeptical.</line><line>&quot;Normally, all submarines go to sea equipped for war.</line><line>I would be surprised if they had gone to sea without something,&quot; said Paul Beaver, a British analyst.</line><line>There was also concern about a possible radiation leak from the vessel's two nuclear reactors.</line><line>&quot;The problem with the nuclear propulsion system is that if the submarine has damaged itself while it was running aground, then you've got a reasonable chance that there will be some sort of radioactive leakage,&quot; said Lionel Trippett of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.</line><line>Norway, which has a scientific vessel in the region, detected no sign of a radiation leak, said Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Karsten Klepsvik.</line><line>Vladimir Gundarov, a submarine specialist at Red Star, the official daily newspaper of the Russian military, said rescuing people from a submarine is very difficult and there is no set procedure.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="17"/></line><line>The Russian navy does not have advanced submarine rescue vessels, according to standard naval reference works.</line><line>The crew may be able to use on-board capsules to escape, but in the worst case would have to swim out through the torpedo tubes, which would be very dangerous, he said.</line><line>In a 1983 Soviet submarine accident, the crew perished when trying to escape from a depth of 180 feet, according to the Norwegian environmental group Bellona, which closely monitors Russia's northern fleet.</line><line>The Kursk, launched in 1995, carries 107 personnel and weighs some 14,000 tons, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, an authoritative guide to warships.</line><line>Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of accidents in recent decades.</line><line>The navy, like the rest of the Russian military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no maintenance on its ships.</line><line>In the last major accident involving one of Moscow's nuclear submarines, the Komsomolets sank in April 1989 after catching fire 200 miles north of Norway.</line><line>Forty-two of the 69 Soviet sailors aboard died in the accident and the wrecked hull with its reactor still lies on the sea bottom.</line></document><document name="APW20000817.0101"><line>MURMANSK, Russia (AP) -- Rumors about the sailors trapped in a crippled Russian submarine on the sea floor circulate constantly in the

is useless.</line><line>&quot;We've been calling the hot line ... every day, and they are telling us they have no information.</line><line>They say 'Go to Murmansk and ask journalists,&quot;' said Ludmila Milyutina of St. Petersburg.</line><line>Milyutina, whose son Andrei is on the Kursk, came to Mumansk on Thursday.</line><line>Murmansk stretches for 11 miles along the Kola Bay, with navy bases dotting the area.</line><line>The gray concrete apartment blocks on the hills are home to many who served in the navy or have friends or relatives who still serve.</line><line>With the brief Arctic summer giving way to the first damp, chill stirrings of winter, many people's minds are on the cold inside the Kursk, which probably has not had heat or light since it sank.</line><line>&quot;It's like this kind of weather, only it's dark,&quot; said Duben, the retired submariner.</line><line>He huddled in his padded jacket, pulling his wool cap down over his ears,

served on a submarine.</line><line>&quot;I watched the news five or six times yesterday, worrying all the time,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;I hope they are still alive.&quot;</line><line>Duben said he spends most of his time trying to figure out what could have gone wrong when the Kursk plunged to the bottom during naval exercises.</line><line>The navy said probes revealed massive damage to

Vladimir Dolinin, a 45-year-old bus driver.</line><line>The local branch of the Soldiers' Mothers Committee, which works for servicemen's rights, extended its hours to serve relatives of the Kursk's crew.</line><line>Like other people here, Valentina Fomina of the mother's committee criticized the Russian government for delaying requests for foreign help.</line><line>On Wednesday, four days after the accident, the Russian government asked Britain and Norway to send a mini-submarine and drivers.</line><line>&quot;It hurts that the military was wasting time by rejecting foreign assistance,&quot;

-- With an honor guard in crisp blue uniforms standing at attention on the deck and its flags snapping in the breeze, the nuclear submarine Kursk glided silently out to sea, a symbol of Russian power and pride.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="14"><scu uid="246" label="The Kursk was a Russian nuclear submarine" weight="3"/></annotation></line><line>It was the last time anyone on land would see the nuclear-powered warship that the Russian navy boasted was unsinkable.</line><line>As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers, the Kursk's crew expected to be home in a few days.</line><line>The Kursk was named after the region in southern Russia where Soviet troops in 1943 turned the tide against Nazi Germany's army in the biggest tank battle in history.</line><line>Like the old land battle, the Kursk was intended to turn the tide at sea if there was ever another world war.</line><line>The submarine was a 500-foot-long underwater missile base.</line><line>Its sides bristled with 24 silos, each housing a cruise missile capable of slamming a nuclear warhead at supersonic speed into a target hundreds of miles away.</line><line>The submarine and a dozen like it were designed during the Cold War to destroy the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers with swarms of missiles.</line><line>The Cold War ended a decade ago and the Kursk's nuclear warheads were locked up ashore.</line><line>The Soviet Union had disappeared and Russia was falling apart, sinking deeper into poverty and backwardness.</line><line>With most of its warships too dilapidated to put to sea, the navy staked what little money it had on keeping up the nuclear submarine fleet -- a potent threat that the navies of the United States and other Western nations could not ignore.</line><line>The Kursk was just five years old.</line><line>The crew, nearly half of them officers with advanced technical skills, had been hailed as the navy's elite, a chosen few who could handle any challenge.</line><line>President Vladimir Putin had big plans for the navy and the Kursk.</line><line>The navy exercises that the Kursk sailed to join on Aug. 10 were a prelude for a major step in putting Moscow back on the world stage: the return of a Russian fleet to the Mediterranean in 2001 for the first time in a decade.</line><line>The exercises were big news.</line><line>Russian television showed film of the Northern Fleet in action, the hulking cruisers and nimble destroyers cutting through the waves and warships firing missiles.</line><line>Then on Aug. 14, a Monday, the navy announced that the Kursk had experienced a malfunction.</line><line>The situation was not critical -- the submarine was in radio contact, air and power lines had been hooked up and arrangements were being made to bring the crew up, the navy said.</line><line>Mounting evidence suggests the crewmen were already dead and almost every utterance by top officials about saving the Kursk would turn out to be untrue.</line><line>The Kursk was rising to the surface, possibly preparing to fire a torpedo on Aug. 12 when disaster struck.</line><line>Nothing is known about what the crew was doing in those last few moments.</line><line>Norwegian monitors later reported detecting an explosion in the vicinity of the Kursk, followed within minutes by a much larger blast that registered at 3.5 on seismic monitors, equivalent to a small earthquake.</line><line>All the signs suggest a problem in the torpedo compartment at the front of the Kursk.</line><line>The submarine was carrying a new type of torpedo with a liquid fuel system that some officers complained was unstable, according to some reports.</line><line>Or the young, inexperienced conscript sailors may have fumbled one of the torpedoes or the test firing may have gone wrong, the weapon jamming in a torpedo tube.</line><line>The first blast must have convulsed the Kursk, knocking out control systems and pitching it into a sharp dive toward the bottom 350 feet below the waves.</line><line>Crewmen would have been knocked sprawling as the submarine plunged out of control.</line><line>Officers in the command center would have been shouting for reports, trying to determine what had happened.</line><line>Maybe there was time to hit the alarm system, but the whole crew already knew they were in serious trouble.</line><line>The first blast probably killed and injured some of the sailors.</line><line>Survivors would have been shouting for help, for first aid crews, frantically trying to reach injured comrades.</line><line>Plunging down at mounting speed and with the decks slanting sharply forward, sailors would have been fighting to stay on their feet or in their seats as the Kursk plunged into the depths.</line><line>They never regained control.</line><line>A second, catastrophic explosion ripped through the Kursk, probably as it slammed into the bottom.</line><line>This blast was probably torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles detonating.</line><line>Russia's navy says it was about 2 tons of explosives going up; some officers say it could have been more than 10 tons.</line><line>The hull was twisted like a wet towel being squeezed dry.</line><line>The Kursk was built of immensely strong steel to withstand the enormous pressures of diving hundreds of feet.</line><line>The hull would have contained and intensified the explosion.</line><line>Following the path of least resistance, the blast ripped backward, breaking through the thinner walls of the crew compartments.</line><line>Most of the crew were within yards of the blast.</line><line>Navy officers say that many were probably vaporized by the detonation; others were ripped to bits.</line><line>Anybody still alive after the second explosion was almost certainly stunned, probably deafened and unconscious.</line><line>Kursk's nuclear reactors appear to have shut down, plunging the submarine into darkness.</line><line>The explosions ripped at least one large hole in the hull.</line><line>Tons of water surged in, quickly filling the submarine.</line><line>Anyone who survived the explosions almost certainly drowned, the navy says.</line><line>There may never be an exact reconstruction of the last moments of the Kursk.</line><line>It did not have black boxes like those which can tell what happened to a crashed airliner.</line><line>Raising the Kursk may be impossible, meaning that its secrets will be lost forever.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1"

accident of the submarine Kursk sinking in the Barents Sea on August 12 has rejected 11 original explanations for the disaster, but still cannot conclude what caused the tragedy indeed, Russian Deputy Premier Ilya Klebanov said here Friday.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="3" sums="2,3,32"><scu uid="3" label="The Kursk sank in the Barents Sea" weight="4"/></annotation></line><line>There remain three possible reasons to be further inquired, but none of them can be directly corroborated now, Klebanov, who is also the chairman of the commission, told a hearing at the State Duma, lower house of parliament.</line><line>One explanation presumes that the submarine hit a World War II mine, the second is that the Kursk collided with another submarine, and the third is that an explosion took place

humans.</line><line>Attempts to simulate the third situation at a testing ground have so far failed.</line><line>Sabotage and errors on the part of the crew were rejected as possible causes, he added.</line><line>Although the radiation background in the Barents Sea is normal, the submarine must be raised &quot;for various reasons,&quot; he stressed.</line><line>He attributed &quot;inconsistencies in reporting the disaster&quot; to the overwhelming amount of incoming information, especially during the first three days after the sinking, and an inability to sort it out.</line></document></collection>
