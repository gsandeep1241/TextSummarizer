Cisneros said.</line><line>&quot;It feels good.&quot;</line><line>Cisneros is the poster child for what Horn is trying to accomplish.</line><line>&quot;With having these focus groups and being positive, we are setting a new foundation built on character,&quot; Horn said.</line><line>&quot;When you put character and issues of human spirit first, the grades, accomplishments, morale and everything else follow.&quot;</line><line>Elsewhere on campus, students and faculty members joined to build their school anew.</line><line>They helped janitors clean closets and throw away years of debris.</line><line>Horn, who believes in the therapeutic effects of animals on humans, brings his dog, Blue, to school with him every day.</line><line>&quot;He was a stray I found at my last school, and I found the kids loved it when he ran around campus,&quot; Horn said.</line><line>&quot;He's been a hit here so far.&quot;</line><line>But the rebirth of the campus community is what stands out the most.</line><line>&quot;Instead of threatening us not to be violent or bad, the teachers are trusting us with everything ... and they keep trusting us,&quot;

Shamrock Principal Tom Davis says with regret, by way of explaining the scare-'em-straight signs on his walls.</line><line>&quot;It's nothing like when I was a kid in school.&quot;</line><line>Yet these measures, while easy to understand and media-genic, may not offer the only - or the best - hope at preventing violence at school.</line><line>Shamrock and other schools, in addition to employing the &quot;hardware approach,&quot; also have launched a new strategy to make schools both safer and happier in the long run: what might be called the human approach.<annotation scu-count="2" sum-count="1" sums="18"><scu uid="305" label="Schools nationwide are taking measures to prevent school violence.

says Bill Modzelski of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program of the U.S. Department of Education.</line><line>&quot;So we have to depend on prevention - getting to the roots of the problem.</line><line>And that means awareness of the kids' family structure, drug and alcohol problems, making sure someone takes responsibility to know if a child is happy or sad.</line><line>Schools are so big now, kids pass through and nobody knows they're there.&quot;</line><line>Metal detectors are uncommon in metro Atlanta, but they are credited with sharply reducing violence in New York City.</line><line>Warning signs and surveillance cameras are widely used locally, and while they may well be helping to limit violence, they also add an oppressive air to schools.</line><line>Some students resent that cameras &quot;make everyone feel like a suspect,&quot;

says the 13-year-old, one of the 10 percent of Shamrock's 1,057 students who are mentored.</line><line>&quot;He tells me, 'Don't get mad, don't hit him, even if he was messing with you first.'</line><line>It's good advice.&quot;</line><line>Jennifer Haygood, 13, adds: &quot;I can talk from the heart to my mentor, and I don't come in all mad-crazy wanting to blow up the school.&quot;</line><line>She smiles as she says this.</line><line>She just means normal modern frustration.</line><line>Principal Davis feels that mentoring helps students vent anxieties that might otherwise explode.</line><line>&quot;That's one of the underlying reasons we have a safe school,&quot; he says.</line><line>You could see the human approach at work at DeKalb's Soapstone Center for the Arts the other day.</line><line>A group of students age 9 to 18 was creating their own anger-management play to tour DeKalb schools.</line><line>Just when the actors were about to erupt into staged fights, they stopped short - took a deep breath, slipped on dark glasses and repeated the play's clever, cautionary tag line, &quot;Get in the cool zone!&quot;</line><line>DeKalb schools have broadened the definition of bullying to include not just physical intimidation but &quot;any kind of harassment that isolates a child,&quot; says DeKalb schools spokesman Spencer Ragsdale.</line><line>&quot;Teachers are trained to look not only for the obvious victims of bullying, but to reach out to the kid who isn't picked for teams, who eats lunch alone.</line><line>That's where the pain starts.&quot;</line><line>Policies on bullying are posted on the county's Web page (www.dekalb.k12 under &quot;What's New&quot;) along with findings from a Norwegian study on bullying that was discovered on the Web.</line><line>DeKalb's school district also has been the most aggressive locally in enforcing the new state anti-bullying law, expelling at least 12 students since August and sending them for a semester or two to alternative schools where the student-teacher ratio is lower, and the number of psychology-based courses, such as decision-making and anger management, is higher.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="18"><scu uid="334" label="Children are being taught anger management." weight="3"/></annotation></line><line>&quot;Kids have access to so much violent entertainment, spend so much time in a world where conflicts are resolved with a gun,&quot;

he says.</line><line>&quot;That feeling may begin at home.</line><line>A 13-year-old kid left in his room with a ton of entertainment equipment, or dropped at the mall to hang out all afternoon - that's not independence.</line><line>That's isolation.</line><line>Parents need to talk to their kids and offer support before that anger grows.&quot;</line><line>Indeed, reaching parents - persuading them that bullying isn't a necessary rite of passage to toughen a kid's hide - is almost as big a challenge as reaching students, McGiboney says.</line><line>When addressing parents' groups, he begins by asking how many were bullied as youngsters, and almost everyone's hand goes up.</line><line>&quot;Then I ask, 'How many still think about that bullying today?' and nearly every hand stays up,&quot;

said Sgt. James Stewart of the Atlanta police department, who supervises officers assigned to the city's schools.</line><line>&quot;We were far more concerned a few years ago when we had to arrange to assess and get some psychological attention for some kids from the Atlanta schools who were in a local mall when some guy came through and shot it up.&quot;</line><line>&quot;In the week right after Columbine, the call volume to us increased tremendously,&quot; said Jim Jones, vice president of Security Voice, Inc.
