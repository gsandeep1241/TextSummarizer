millions, of Americans with arthritis are taking a combination of obscure nutritional supplements.</line><line>Whatever made these pills the latest cure, it's certainly not the way their names roll off the tongue.</line><line>Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate.</line><line>Hard to imagine marketing executives coming up with those tongue-twisters.</line><line>It's also not because a lot of arthritis specialists are pushing them on their patients.</line><line>Mention health store pills to most doctors, and the response is likely to fall somewhere between a blank look and a condescending smile.</line><line>The real reasons, it seems, are a cleverly titled book, a hard-to-treat disease that afflicts 16 million Americans and that most elusive and powerful of marketing forces, a good buzz on the street.</line><line>Or the golf course.</line><line>Or wherever else men and women of a certain age gather and talk about what's aching them.</line><line>Across the country, folks have seized on these over-the-counter pills as a new way to ease throbbing knees and hands, even though the opinion of the medical establishment is, to put it politely, skeptical.</line><line>Just how many of these people are truly finding relief is impossible to say, but clearly the experience has made believers of some.</line><line>Among them is Ralph Cushman, 49, a real estate lawyer in Anchorage, Alaska.</line><line>Cushman is the kind of guy who lives to hike and fish.</line><line>Those pleasures gradually grew difficult as old injuries stiffened his knees with arthritis, making walking painful.</line><line>On a hunting trip two years ago, he got 500 feet (150 meters) up a mountain and could go no farther.</line><line>&quot;It was heartbreaking.&quot; he recalled.</line><line>&quot;Suddenly, I couldn't deer hunt anymore.</line><line>All the things I lived for were slipping away.&quot;</line><line>His doctor told him nothing could be done.</line><line>Take pain pills and live with it.</line><line>Cushman limped to a bookstore.</line><line>There he found something that, in his mind, changed his life.</line><line>&quot;The Arthritis Cure,&quot; written by Dr. Jason Theodosakis, lays out a program of exercise, diet and glucosamine and chondroitin.</line><line>The book has sold more than 1.4 million copies since it came out last year.</line><line>Cushman followed its directions.</line><line>&quot;Within days, I realized it was making a tremendous difference,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;Suddenly I could out-hike my boys rather than hollering for them to wait.</line><line>There was just no question this was working.</line><line>I assure you, you cannot make that kind of pain go away with a placebo.&quot;</line><line>&quot;Placebo&quot; is just one of the words that comes up when arthritis doctors get onto this subject.</line><line>They correctly point out that a belief something will work is often powerful medicine in itself.</line><line>Indeed, when researchers test possible arthritis drugs, about 30 percent feel better even when they are in the comparison group getting sugar pills.</line><line>Some doctors suspect this may at least partly explain why people find relief from glucosamine and chondroitin.</line><line>&quot;Patients invest time and money in them and they want them to work, so they are more likely to see a positive effect than a negative one,&quot; said Dr. Jonathan Kay of the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1"

around the joints and weight loss to reduce some of the stress.</line><line>Mainstream practitioners also usually recommend anti-inflammatory drugs.</line><line>Among these are aspirin, Motrin and other other-the-counter painkillers and a variety of prescription medicines.</line><line>But many patients suffer despite these pills, and steady use can have serious side effects, such as stomach ulcers and liver damage.</line><line>According to one estimate, anti-inflammatory drugs contribute to more than 7,000 deaths in the United States annually.</line><line>Furthermore, the medicines do nothing to slow the progression of arthritis.</line><line>Unlike these drugs, glucosamine (pronounced glue-COSE-uh-mean) and chondroitin (conn-DROY-tin) are already present in the body as building material of cartilage.</line><line>Proponents theorize that taking extra glucosamine stimulates new cartilage production, while chondroitin slows its destruction.</line><line>To hear them tell it, these supplements not only relieve or eliminate the pain, they can also stop and even reverse the disease.</line><line>And they do all this with no side effects.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="22"/></line><line>To which many arthritis experts reply: Show us the proof.</line><line>Most studies of glucosamine and chondroitin were done several years ago in Europe.</line><line>In general, they suggest that the supplements work about as well as over-the-counter painkillers in easing the ache.</line><line>In the test tube, they appear to stimulate and preserve cartilage.</line><line>However, skeptics note these studies were small, not particularly well done and didn't combine glucosamine and chondroitin, which is the way most people now take them.</line><line>Dr. Doyt Conn, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation, said the supplements appear to be safe, and they may indeed do some good for some people, but his organization cannot recommend them until there are better scientific data.</line><line>&quot;We have to be responsible to the public and give them what reliable information there is to make a judgment,&quot; Conn said.</line><line>&quot;Right now, I don't think that information is out there.&quot;</line><line>Several U.S. studies are under way, sponsored by companies that make the supplements.</line><line>The

Jonas, drew criticism because he practiced homeopathy, a 200-year-old system of medicine in which illnesses are often treated with diluted solutions of plant extracts.</line><line>Most mainstream scientists, including Varmus, take a dim view of homeopathy.</line><line>As a result, said Jonas, who left the institutes at the end of 1998, he had a difficult time getting approval of proposals to finance research.</line><line>But as Congress continued to appropriate more money for the office and public interest grew, Varmus said, &quot;I came to feel that there was a real public health concern that NIH had a responsibility to address.&quot;</line><line>By 1996, the alternative medicine office had moved onto the main institutes' campus, and Varmus had formed an advisory group of government scientists to set priorities.</line><line>The alternative medicine literature contains thousands of studies, but the majority are scientifically flawed.</line><line>Varmus wants scientists to test the most promising and most widely used therapies.</line><line>But the critics remain.</line><line>Herbert, the Mount Sinai professor, calls the institutes' center on alternative medicine &quot;a worthless waste of money&quot; that was &quot;set up to promote fraud.&quot;</line><line>Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, said the center had so far failed to publish any significant articles in scientific journals.</line><line>&quot;The proof is in the pudding,&quot; Dr. Angell said.</line><line>&quot;Just show me the papers.&quot;</line><line>That may take some time.</line><line>It will be three to four years, Straus predicts, before the current crop of clinical trials is complete.</line><line>Still, in a recent interview, Straus came armed with two loose-leaf notebooks full of articles that had grown from NIH-financed research, some published in the respected Journal of the American Medical Association.</line><line>He acknowledged that the center &quot;still has to prove itself.&quot;</line><line>But, he said, &quot;I predict it will.&quot;</line><line>For the American health care system, the implications of the new research will be vast, medically and economically.</line><line>Health maintenance organizations are just beginning to cover some alternative therapies; Oxford Health Plans, for instance, offers coverage for acupuncture.</line><line>If therapies being tested prove effective, patients will undoubtedly begin demanding coverage.</line><line>The new research could be a boon to manufacturers of herbs.</line><line>Several manufacturers of dietary supplements are beginning studies of products like ginkgo and St. John's wort that could lead to their approval by the Food and Drug Administration, in the same way the agency approves prescription drugs, said Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association, a trade group.</line><line>The University of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is joining Chinese scientists to develop herbal medicines as drugs.</line><line>In addition, Dr. Steven DeKosky, who directs the university's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, has also received a $3 million NIH grant to see if the ginkgo herb can prevent dementia.</line><line>Two thousand elderly patients will be enrolled.</line><line>If it works, he said, the next step will be to isolate the active ingredients and figure out how they work.</line><line>Some researchers, including Eisenberg of Harvard, say alternative therapies will not be truly accepted as mainstream until scientists can prove not just that they work, but how.</line><line>But already, medical practice is opening up, said Dr. Marc C. Hochberg, the rheumatology professor at the University of Maryland, who is an investigator in the acupuncture study.</line><line>This year, acupuncture was mentioned for the first time in the American College of Rheumatology's guidelines for medical management of osteoarthritis of the knee.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="24"/></line><line>&quot;Our work has opened people's eyes,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;This used to be in the same ball park as copper bracelets.</line><line>I think we have taken acupuncture for osteoarthritis out of that realm.&quot;<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="17"/></line><line>Still, Hochberg said, an important question remains: does the acupuncture really work, or is it just the placebo effect?</line><line>Hochberg hopes to have an answer by 2002.</line><line>As for Katcoff, he is sold.</line><line>He said he had been reading up on Chinese medicine, and had learned that even people who did not believe in it could benefit.</line><line>&quot;I think I'm getting the real goods,&quot; he said recently, moments after a treatment.</line><line>&quot;I've been going twice a week, and this is my fifth week, and I can honestly say that the pains in the back of my legs are gone.&quot;</line></document><document name="NYT20000131.0294"><line>The ancient technique of acupuncture is now being used for cosmetic surgery.</line><line>&quot; Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy called Qi flows,&quot; says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport Beach, Calif.</line><line>&quot;Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety of conditions this way.&quot;</line><line>Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West keep expanding.</line><line>Inserting needles into pressure points throughout the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,5000 years.</line><line>But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents a whole new concept in cosmetics.</line><line>&quot;The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles underneath the skin,&quot; says Woo.</line><line>&quot;Stimulating energy centers restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body.&quot;</line><line>&quot;I'm pleased,&quot; says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach, California.</line><line>&quot;I can see that the fine lines under my eyes lessened, and my smile lines diminished a lot.</line><line>I'm most pleased about that.&quot;</line><line>Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture treatments.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="17"/></line><line>But inviting as the treatment seems, not many acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.</line><line>In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain, adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility.</line><line>&quot;It opens the channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's cells.</line><line>The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate wrinkles.&quot;</line><line>Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease their anxiety.</line><line>&quot;I help patients overcome their fear of needles by first showing them that I use very fine, disposable needles made of steel.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="25"/></line><line>They don't hurt.&quot;</line><line>Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed atmosphere.</line><line>The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from patient to patient.</line><line>Some require as few as nine, and others need 16 or so placed strategically around their face.</line><line>&quot;The needles bring more circulation to the area where they are inserted,&quot; says Woo, &quot;which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells.</line><line>The needles activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more elasticity.&quot;</line><line>After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape to put pressure on the muscles.</line><line>Anesthesia cream is applied to the sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort.</line><line>Then he inserts the needles at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top of the head.</line><line>This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in place for about a half hour.</line><line>Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate circulation to the face.</line><line>&quot;It's the same pressure point used to stop a toothache or a headache,&quot; he explains.</line><line>Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes.</line><line>A Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin.</line><line>Ten treatments usually do the job.</line><line>Then, maintenance visits once or twice a month renew the benefits.</line><line>Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45 for each acupuncture treatment.</line><line>Woo explains that restoring the essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and increases a sense of well being.</line><line>This shows in the face.</line><line>&quot;Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling sensation when needles are inserted,&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;That is then followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease.&quot;</line><line>Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to achieving beauty than a surgical facelift.</line><line>The focus on the whole person and improving energy flow appeals to many.</line><line>&quot;From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years even if you have good skin tone,&quot; says Sandy Ridout, &quot;which I do.</line><line>Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that.</line><line>But if I can put it off, that's a good idea, I think.</line><line>Acupuncture seems like a better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to keep up.</line><line>And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time.</line><line>I enjoy the procedure.&quot;</line><line>A consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health states that acupuncture has been used by millions of Americans.</line><line>Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.</line><line>Since the field still remains relatively new to the public, issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need further clarification.</line><line>The majority of states offer licensure or registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the same credentialing exam.</line><line>A nationally recognized exam has been established, however, for physicians who become acupuncturists.</line><line>The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed acupuncture needles from the category of &quot;experimental medical devices,&quot; and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes.</line><line>This ensures good manufacturing practices and high standards of sterility.</line><line>The FDA recommends that the needles be used only once.</line><line>The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and fibromyalgia.</line><line>The consensus panel concluded that further research is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture interventions will be helpful.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="17"/></line><line>Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all encompassing way for some patients.</line><line>&quot;I feel like I'm brighter,&quot; says Sandy Ridout.</line><line>&quot;It gives me a better feeling just to know I don't have wrinkles.</line><line>&quot;I'm a preventive type person, and my appearance and my mood are important to me.</line><line>I needed a perker-upper and this is it.&quot;.</line><line>(The HealthSurfing.com Web site at http://healthsurfing.com contains further information.)</line></document><document

any proof related thereto, suggested use and cost.</line><line>GLUCOSAMINE SULFATE .</line><line>Claim: Glucosamine, a natural substance, furnishes the building blocks that our bodies use to make and repair cartilage.</line><line>Proof: Some recent well-done research shows that glucosamine soothes knee pain as well as ibuprofen does, but without the side effects.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="27"><scu uid="259" label="Glucosamine relieves arthritis pain as well as ibuprofen, without the side effects." weight="2"/></annotation></line><line>Suggested Dose: 1,500 milligrams (mg) a day in two or three doses.</line><line>Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 600-mg capsules, $7.99.</line><line>Claim: Experts think that chondroitin, which exists naturally in cartilage, may make tissue more flexible and protect it from harmful chemicals.</line><line>Proof: Some studies show that chondroitin stops joint degeneration, improves joint function and eases pain.</line><line>But evidence is stronger for glucosamine.</line><line>Suggested Dose: 1,200 mg a day in two or three doses.</line><line>(May increase the effects of blood-thinning drugs and

remedies.</line><line>When in doubt, ask your doctor for guidance.</line><line>In the meantime, here are a few products that have not been proven to relieve arthritis - though some have benefits for other conditions:.</line><line>- Copper bracelets: There's no scientific evidence to back up copper's antiarthritis claims.</line><line>- Shark cartilage: Although advertised to help ease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for arthritis.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="27"><scu uid="151"

sulfoxide): A byproduct of wood processing, DMSO is said to ease pain and improve flexibility in people with arthritis.</line><line>But many versions on the market aren't suitable for humans.</line><line>They're chemically impure and potentially harmful.</line><line>- Maybe MSM?</line><line>There is some anecdotal evidence that MSM (methyl sulfonyl methane) may help alleviate arthritis pain.</line><line>So far, no published studies have shown that it's effective for treating arthritis.</line><line>But if you haven't had success with any of the proven arthritis remedies, it's probably safe to try MSM to see if it helps you.</line><line>OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SHOP SMART .</line><line>With so many arthritis supplements on the market, it's hard to know what to buy and what to avoid.</line><line>Our 10-point checklist will help.</line><line>1. Make sure that the product label lists the amount of the active ingredient it contains.</line><line>2. Choose products from large companies - they value their reputations.</line><line>3. Buy supplements at stores you trust.</line><line>4. Avoid products using words such as &quot;scientific breakthrough&quot; or &quot;miracle cure.&quot;</line><line>5.</line><line>Beware of products that claim to cure all types of arthritis.</line><line>6.</line><line>Remember: If a product sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</line><line>7. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplement for arthritis.</line><line>8. Continue taking your current medication until you've gotten your doctor's OK to try something new.</line><line>9. Bear in mind that &quot;natural&quot; doesn't necessarily mean safe.</line><line>10.</line><line>If you already take an arthritis supplement, mention it to your doctor.</line><line>OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: ANTIOXIDANTS FOR ARTHRITIS .</line><line>Need another reason to get your five-a-day?</line><line>Some studies have shown that the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may protect joints - especially the knee - from the ravages of osteoarthritis (OA).</line><line>Here are a few of the studies' findings:.</line><line>- People with high intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene had a reduced risk of knee pain and disease progression.</line><line>- Certain antioxidants (including lutein and lycopene, among others) were associated with lower risk of knee OA.</line><line>- Vitamin E eased arthritis pain better than a placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<annotation scu-count="2" sum-count="3" sums="15,29,8"><scu uid="206" label="Vitamins are being investigated for treatment of arthritis." weight="3"/><scu uid="206" label="Vitamins are being investigated for treatment of arthritis." weight="3"/></annotation></line><line>To be sure that you're getting enough beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene and vitamin C, eat lots of carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, spinach, tomato sauce and tomato juice, oranges, kiwifruit and strawberries.</line><line>(Prevention now recommends nine veggies a day for disease protection.)</line><line>To get the amount of vitamin E that most experts advise, you'll need a vitamin E supplement containing 400 international units.</line><line>Since OA progression was three times higher in people with low levels of vitamin D, it's best to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement with 100 percent of the daily value for D.
