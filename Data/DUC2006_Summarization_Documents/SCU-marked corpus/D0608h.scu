adults.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="3" sums="10,19,35"/></line><line>Critics contend larger adults who don't wear seat belts could be put at greater risk.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>The new rule overhauls the government's standards for air bags, which to date are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives and blamed for at least 158 deaths.</line><line>Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.</line><line>The 25 mph standard will be phased in over three years, starting with 2004 model year vehicles.</line><line>Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries.</line><line>The 25 mph test will not require the air bags to inflate as forcefully as a 30 mph test.</line><line>&quot;At the end of the day, we focused on the most vulnerable and the most at-risk of being killed by the air bags that were supposed to benefit them,&quot; Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said.</line><line>Some consumer groups say the new standard will put more adults at risk because the bags will not be designed to deploy with enough force to protect unbelted larger adults.</line><line>&quot;We need a 30 mph standard because people are more likely to be killed or seriously injured in higher-speed crashes, and this is where air bags have saved the most lives,&quot; said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's nonprofit group.</line><line>NHTSA required a 30 mph test until 1997, when worries about air bags injuring motorists caused the agency to approve a rule that temporarily allowed automakers to use a 25 mph test.</line><line>Rather than change the test, Claybrook said automakers should install dual-power air bags that would inflate at different speeds depending on the severity of impact and size of the occupant.</line><line>The real reason the auto industry wants the 25 mph test, Claybrook said, is that popular sport utility vehicles cannot meet the 30 mph standard because of stiff designs that do not absorb impact as well as cars.</line><line>Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers rejected that argument.</line><line>If it were true, he said, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trauma Society and the National Transportation Safety Board would not support the 25 mph test as the safer alternative.</line><line>&quot;It's certainly not about saving money or about protecting any classification of vehicle,&quot; Roberts said.</line><line>&quot;This rule is going to go so much further in enhancing vehicle safety, it's unprecedented.&quot;</line><line>NHTSA also will require vehicles to be tested using a family of dummies -- an average-size man, a small woman and 1-, 3- and 6-year-old children.</line><line>Previous tests involved only average-size men.</line><line>The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying positions.</line><line>NHTSA estimates the new standards will increase costs by less than $100 per vehicle.</line></document><document name="NYT19980613.0002"><line>LOS ANGELES -- The evacuation of an apartment complex Friday because of an unexploded, stolen air bag reveals what police say is a thriving, illegal trade in these car safety devices.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="5" sums="17,2,28,32,6"/></line><line>In L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, investigators suspect there is at least one roving gang of thieves that specializes in taking orders from body shops and then going out to steal them.</line><line>Nationwide, an estimated $50 million worth of air bags are stolen every year, accounting for 10 percent of all auto theft claims in 1997, double that of just the year before, insurance industry officials said.</line><line>&quot;It's basically a replacement for the car stereo theft of the '80s and early '90s,&quot; said Julie Rochman, spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, based in Arlington, Va.</line><line>&quot;The air bags the thieves are going after are worth more than any other item in the passenger compartment.&quot;</line><line>Following a crash, a new air bag can cost $1,000, but police said unscrupulous body shops buy stolen ones for $150 apiece and then charge $1,500, including the installation.</line><line>And removing an explosively armed air bag, particularly if it is done in a hurry, can leave a car in bad shape.</line><line>&quot;When air bags are stolen, they damage the steering wheel, the dash or cut the wiring harness,&quot; said Frank Tomota, a service consultant at West Valley Toyota in Northridge.</line><line>Insurance premiums are not expected to rise because officials said the growing cost of air bag thefts is offset by an overall decline in auto thefts.</line><line>The real losers are the motorists because with every theft, they must pay the deductible amount, arrange for the repairs and risk driving without an air bag.</line><line>The air bag that was found unexploded in Van Nuys on Friday is among the 12 or so that police said are stolen every month in the Valley.</line><line>Detectives came upon it by happenstance while making an arrest at the Royal Garden Apartments at 14625 Rayen St. About 24 people were evacuated because the air bags contain an explosive charge that can launch its 25-pound metal casing some 80 feet, police said.</line><line>Details about the arrest were not immediately available, but police said they believe the air bag had been stolen, and that they were trying to track down the owner.</line><line>Often a group of thieves hits three or four cars on a street or parking lot and then steals from a neighbor a week or two later, said Detective Bob Graybill of the LAPD's auto-theft task force in Van Nuys.</line><line>The thieves almost always are filling an order from an auto body shop whose owner is trying to cut costs to maximize the payout from the insurance company, he said.</line><line>This can include splicing, instead of replacing, the wiring harness attached to the air bag, or in some cases not installing an air bag at all.</line><line>&quot;The car looks good and the customer is very happy -- and until he gets involved in a crash again and finds out if the air bag works or not, nobody's going to know these are used air bags the guy jury-rigged in there,&quot; Graybill said.</line><line>Los Angeles police are attacking the problem through stepped-up inspections of auto shops to ensure owners are licensed and have receipts for uninstalled air bags.</line><line>By a conservative estimate, 50,000 air bags were stolen in the United States in 1996, roughly triple that of 1993, said Ed Sparkman, a senior manager of vehicle support at the National Insurance Crime Bureau in Palos Hills, Ill.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="32"/></line><line>That equates to a $50 million loss to the insurance industry, assuming the average replacement cost for an air bag is $1,000, he said.</line><line>The actual rate of these thefts is believed to be much higher since these statistics did not account for the commercial auto market and because theft of air bags from rental cars, often by the person renting the car, is booming, he said.</line><line>The industry and law enforcement are now mulling over ways to combat air bag theft by using a national registry of serial numbers.</line><line>Auto parts stores sell anti-theft devices for drivers' air bags, which attach to the steering wheel or special bolts that make it more difficult for a thief to remove the safety device.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2"

answer as more car makers add sport utility models to their lineup.</line><line>And, there are hints that even more makers are about to enter the competition.</line><line>Lexus added to its '99 sport utility lineup earlier this year with the RX 300.</line><line>Now, Cadillac joins in with the Escalade, Suzuki adds the Grand Vitara, and there's even one from Quigley.</line><line>Quigley?</line><line>Well, more about that later.</line><line>Volkswagen and Porsche are planning a joint venture, BMW is said to be working on one, Saab is looking for one, Saturn is giving thoughts to having one and Daewoo, which just entered the American market, reportedly has one in its future.</line><line>Jeep certainly isn't sitting by.</line><line>It has an all-new Grand Cherokee that's bigger, roomier, more powerful, and with a new all-wheel-drive train.</line><line>Reportedly the only things being picked up from the '98 version are 127 screws.</line><line>If there are not already a lot of choices in models, consider, too, that not all sport utility vehicles are alike.</line><line>Which means anyone looking for a SUV has a lot of shopping ahead - not just for price, but for features as well.</line><line>Do you want full-time four-wheel drive, or do you really want all-wheel drive?</line><line>Do you want a low range for off-road adventure, or a choice of two-wheel, four-wheel drive?</line><line>Do you want room to spare?</line><line>Do you want to feel the ruts or ride in carlike comfort?</line><line>How high off the road do you want to be?</line><line>How easy is it to shift between drives?</line><line>What's the noise level inside like?</line><line>How does it feel going around a corner?</line><line>(Some SUVs, especially some of the smaller ones, give the feeling of an impending rollover.</line><line>If it doesn't feel right, don't go for it.)</line><line>These are questions you should answer before putting your money down.</line><line>Surveys have shown that more than 95 percent of sport-utility owners never go off-road.</line><line>They simply use them for shopping, commuting, hauling the kids, a boat or a trailer.</line><line>Still, for auto dealers, a SUV or two on the lot is a must.</line><line>That's one reason Cadillac, for the first time in its 96-year history, is putting its name on a truck.</line><line>Sales of the Lincoln Navigator were too much for Cadillac to bear, it needed something to keep its flock in the Cadillac tent.</line><line>Enter the Cadillac Escalade.</line><line>The Escalade is basically an even fancier, smoother-riding version of the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Denali.</line><line>It's not as huge as the Lincoln Navigator but it has plenty of power in its 255 horsepower engine, and can make grand music with its Bose Acoustimass sound system.</line><line>The Jeep Grand Cherokee, its fans say, leaves almost nothing to desire.</line><line>The new Grand Cherokee may look a lot like the old, but its a far different riding, handling, all-around vehicle.</line><line>Some have reported it outclasses the Mercedes M-Class, and Chrysler reportedly was going to promote that, until they became part of the Mercedes family.</line><line>Make your own comparisons.</line><line>There's just about nothing Chrysler didn't change on the '99.</line><line>There's a new engine, new all-wheel-drive system, more room, new seats, new transmission, well, it's all new.</line><line>Even the spare tire has been taken out of the cargo area and placed under the vehicle.</line><line>Chrysler hasn't missed a trick - it spend $2.65 billion, including $750 million in plant preparation.</line><line>The new Quadra-Drive system is designed to keep the Jeep going even if three wheels lose traction.</line><line>It has a new suspension designed for better ride and handling.</line><line>And its new 16-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 is said to offer better mileage, and 30 percent less emissions.</line><line>Add to that a long list of luxury items, including dual climate zones, and you have quite a vehicle to go just about anywhere.</line><line>The Laredo version starts at $26,220, the Limited at $34,415 for the four-wheel drive version.</line><line>The luxury market for SUVs is growing.</line><line>General Motors added the Denali last spring, loading it with lots of amenities to set it apart from the GMC Yukon.</line><line>Its one-price comes with just about everything.</line><line>The same is true of GMC's new top-of-the-line, everything-included Envoy, which has features not available in any other GM SUV product.</line><line>It's nicely styled and equipped.</line><line>While lots of manufacturers are citing the &quot;carlike&quot; ride of their SUVs, GM is stressing the &quot;trucklike&quot; strength of their models, which may have a carlike ride, but are built on truck frames.</line><line>Lexus entered the SUV market last March with the RX300 ($31,500), and like other Lexus products, shows a lot of innovation along with comfort features.</line><line>The RX300 raises the question of what is a SUV?</line><line>This new entry to the market certainly doesn't look like a sport utility, it rides more like a car (it is built on a Camry frame), and it lacks a low-range gear for true off-road driving.</line><line>But it has all the other SUV attributes - high seating, all-wheel drive, and roomy interior.</line><line>It also gets better mileage than most SUVs - around 19 miles to the gallon.</line><line>Lexus also offers the LX470 ($58,500), a full-size, full-time 4wd with V-8 power that is new this year, replacing the LX450.</line><line>The vehicle is similar to the Toyota Land Cruiser.</line><line>The new vehicles are aimed at becoming the &quot;King of 4WD,&quot; according to Toyota.</line><line>The vehicles have a new 32-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 that offers a 7 percent fuel gain, a new Automatic Height Control system allowing the driver to raise the body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button, a new heating system, better stability, and a spacious interior.</line><line>Winning accolades since its '98 introduction is the Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility.</line><line>The ML320 ($34,950) has been cited for its ride, safety, ruggedness, performance, fuel economy, usability and price - it's in the same range as a top-of-the-line Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee.</line><line>Consumer Reports puts it at the top of its SUV list.</line><line>The only problem with the V-6 powered ML320 is availability - it's a long wait for the Alabama-produced vehicle.</line><line>This year, Mercedes adds a second model, the ML430 with V-8 power.</line><line>Some of the nice touches of the M-Class include bumpers set at the same level as a car (unlike other SUVs, the Mercedes bumper won't end up in a car's body, causing additional damage during a collision), BabySmart automatic child seat recognition (a system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child is in a booster seat in front), and a new Power Skyview Top option that offers a huge roof opening (about four-feet by three-feet wide).</line><line>Ford is still king of the hill when it comes to sales of its Explorer and near twin, Mercury Mountaineer.</line><line>For '99 the Explorer adds a Reverse Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to alert drivers of objects when backing up), side airbags, Homelink (a remote control for opening garage doors, lights, etc), Travelnote, an electronic message organizer that records and plays messages.</line><line>On an environmental note, both the Explorer and Expedition (Mountaineer and Navigator, as well) are now low-emission vehicles, producing 40 percent less smog-forming emissions than before.</line><line>The Expedition, Ford's huge SUV, adds an optional power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals that can be adjusted up to 3 inches, a plus for shorter drivers.</line><line>These features can also be found in the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercury Mountaineer.</line><line>In the lower price range, Suzuki is out to set a new standard for mini-sport-utility vehicles.</line><line>The Grand Vitara ($21,429) will be the first in its class to have a V-6 engine, and with its body built onto a steel ladder frame like larger SUVs, this vehicle is a true off-roader, complete with a four-wheel drive system.</line><line>It includes a two-speed transfer case with low range for climbing and descending steep hills.</line><line>The inside of the Grand Vitara is said to almost equal that of the Jeep Cherokee.</line><line>The Grand Vitara is joined by two four-cylinder versions: the Suzuki Vitara and the Chevrolet Tracker.</line><line>These will be available as two-door convertible or four-door hardtop.</line><line>The V-6 will only be available at Suzuki dealers.</line><line>Kia, a Korean company, has slowly been making its way to the East Coast and arrived in New England this fall.</line><line>Along with it comes the Kia Sportage, which is designed to appeal to Generation X in style, and more importantly, in price.</line><line>The Kia Sportage starts at $14,445, a thousand or more dollars less than competitors such as the Isuzu Amigo and Toyota RAV4.</line><line>The Kia will be available as a two-door convertible and four-door model.</line><line>Ever since Consumer Reports labeled the 1996 Isuzu Trooper II and the 1988 Suzuki Samurai as being unacceptable for, in Consumer Union's eye, a tendency to roll over in emergency tests, consumers have become aware that this could be a problem in any SUV.</line><line>SUVs sit high above the road and, therefore, tend to lean more in turns than lower profile automobiles.</line><line>The new Land Rover Discovery Series II offers a computer-assisted system that should allay this unsettling feeling.</line><line>The Discovery features ACE - active cornering enhancement - which uses hydraulic levers that counter the lateral tilt of the vehicle's body.</line><line>This is the only vehicle sold in America that offers such a system.</line><line>The Land Rover Discovery II ($35,000) is the second generation of this model.</line><line>The new model is slightly lower and six inches longer than last year's.</line><line>The added space goes for cargo and rear-seat passengers.</line><line>The new model also comes with another first - an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine braking on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as needed.</line><line>The Discovery is also four inches wider than the '98, and has a V-8 engine that has added power and torque.</line><line>Other SUVs already on the market include the Acura SLX ($38,300), Chevrolet Blazer ($21,600), the monstrous Chevrolet/GMC Suburban ($25,500), Dodge Durango ($27,000), available with an optional 5.9-liter V-8, the biggest engine in its class; GMC Jimmy ($21,800), Honda CR-V ($18,300), Honda Passport ($$23,800), Infiniti QX4 ($35,550), Isuzu Rodeo ($17,900), Isuzu Trooper

the message.</line><line>Mercedes has developed a number of safety features over the years that the company freely allows others to copy.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="29"/></line><line>When it comes to a safe vehicle, driving a Mercedes has been compared to driving a tank.</line><line>It's a solid vehicle.</line><line>Ford is promoting its Windstar minivan as a safe vehicle.</line><line>It received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's five-star award in crash test ratings.</line><line>The only other minivan to receive the award is the '98 Toyota Sienna.</line><line>Windstar offers such added features as standard foam and cushioning in the ceiling and window pillars to help reduce head injuries in a crash.</line><line>The Ford minivan comes with two options for even safer driving: side airbags designed for front-seat passengers to cushion both the head and torso in a side crash, and a reverse-sensing system that starts beeping when the bumper is 5.9 feet away from an obstacle and sounds more frequently as the vehicle gets closer to the object.</line><line>The beeping is heard only inside the minivan.</line><line>Almost all cars and most trucks now have dual front air bags as standard equipment.</line><line>More air bags, though, are on the way.</line><line>Since their introduction a couple of years ago, side airbags are beginning to show up in more and more vehicles.</line><line>The bags are mounted either in the front door panels or on the side of the front seats.</line><line>With the controversy over injuries and, in some cases, deaths as the result of airbag deployments, a number of vehicles now are equipped with &quot;second generation&quot; bags.</line><line>These units tend not to explode with the force of earlier versions.</line><line>Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="15,8"/></line><line>Many trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to prevent such injuries.</line><line>Mercedes-Benz is now offering its Baby-Smart seat system in all models.</line><line>When a baby seat that Mercedes offers is placed in the front, a sensor deactivates the air bag on that side of the car.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="3" sums="15,24,8"/></line><line>This year, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo added air bag &quot;curtains&quot; to some models.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="2" sums="15,8"><scu uid="70" label="Curtains could help to prevent injury in accidents" weight="3"/></annotation></line><line>The curtains cover just about the entire door.</line><line>BMW offers a tube-like airbag that extends across the top of the front doors to help protect the heads of front-seat passengers.</line><line>As of Sept. 1, manufacturers were required to add extra padding around windows to protect against head injuries.</line><line>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the new curtain-style airbags are innovative technology that surpass the extra padding ruling.</line><line>Side-impact airbags have already found their way into low-priced cars such as the Toyota Corolla.</line><line>Some luxury makers are also adding these for rear seat passengers.</line><line>For true safety, however, the use of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key element.<annotation scu-count="1" sum-count="1" sums="14"><scu uid="1" label="The seat belt is the most effective automobile safety device" weight="3"/></annotation></line><line>Relying on the air bags alone won't do the trick.</line><line>Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="33"/></line><line>Some makers are giving added protection to avoid whiplash injuries.</line><line>Volvo has a new whiplash Protection System allowing the seat backrest and head restraint to shift backward during rear-end collisions.</line><line>The system, Volvo says, reduces the force resulting from rear impact by 50 percent.</line><line>Saab also offers a similar system.</line><line>Many luxury vehicles are providing driver-systems that sense steering and traction conditions and automatically adjust to prevent spinouts.</line><line>BMW is including one in its new 3-Series.</line><line>Antilock brakes have been hailed as almost more important in preventing accidents than airbags.</line><line>The brakes are intended to prevent cars from skidding on slippery surfaces during a sudden stop and to aid in stopping faster.</line><line>The problem with antilock brakes is many people don't know how to use them.</line><line>Unlike regular brakes, which many drivers learned to pump in emergencies, antilock brakes do the pumping automatically.</line><line>Drivers pumping antilock brakes make them less effective.</line><line>Mercedes-Benz now has a system called Brake-Assist that uses a computer to determine when the use of the brakes is an emergency.</line><line>When this situation occurs, the computer automatically adds extra pressure to the brakes.</line><line>Mercedes says stopping distances can be reduced by up to 45 percent.</line><line>Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively.</line><line>Having the right tires for your make and model and having them properly inflated are very important, in even the simplest of stops.</line><line>Corvette was one of the first to offer a device that warns of low air pressure.</line><line>The feature can now be found on other General Motors makes.</line><line>The system is tied to the antilock brake system.</line><line>When a sensor detects a loss of air, it triggers a warning light on the instrument panel indicating which tire is low.</line><line>Stopping by the side of the road to repair a flat tire can be one of the most dangerous things a motorist can do There are too many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing vehicle.</line><line>Some '99s are coming with tires that are capable of running for a while with a complete loss of air - long enough to find help or a safe place off the highway to change the tire.</line><line>Getting a better grip on the road is what all-wheel-drive is about.</line><line>With AWD - not four-wheel-drive - power is shifted to the wheel or wheels needing it most.</line><line>Even if traction is lost on three wheels, new systems from Jeep and Mercedes will shift the power to the one wheel with traction, keeping the vehicle from skidding on ice or snow.</line><line>AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and Mercedes.</line><line>Another new safety feature expected to be adapted by many manufacturers is blue-tint headlights designed to give drivers better road sight at night.</line><line>High-intensity discharge, or HID, headlights illuminate by creating an electric arc between two electrodes in a bulb filled with xenon gas.</line><line>These new lights have been designed to help older drivers see better.</line></document><document name="NYT19990625.0391"><line>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</line><line>-- You undoubtedly have heard about the &quot;black box&quot; federal

correct in many cases - that American cars were inferior to foreign models and that little differentiated one domestic from another.</line><line>Today, thanks in part to that foreign pressure, Americans shopping for domestic autos have plenty of quality from which to choose, even as many of these cars remain distinctly American in flavor.</line><line>The 2000 Mercury Sable LS is a case in point.</line><line>Redesigned this year - lowered at nose and rear, a smooth line running up over windshield and high roof and linking the ends in a graceful arc - the sedan is a sleeker looking car than in the past.</line><line>The Sable comes as a wagon, as well, and engine options include a pair of 3.0 liters, one turning out 153 horsepower, the other, 200 horsepower.</line><line>With the bigger engine I got just over 24 miles per gallon.</line><line>Inside, the car is big, broad American.</line><line>In the LS model tested, the leather seats are wide and firm, essentially five bucket seats.</line><line>The thigh support up front is very good, though bucket seats need better lateral support ridges than the Sable seats offer.</line><line>The dash is deep up top and angles away nicely below, affording plenty of legroom up front.</line><line>Rear legroom is ample, as well.</line><line>A new feature - one that ought to catch on everywhere - is height adjustment (about 3 inches) on the gas and brake pedals.</line><line>Push a button on the side of the driver's seat and the pedals come to or move away from you.</line><line>For short drivers, this means they no longer have to move the seat far forward, pushing themselves right up to the steering wheel and bluntly in the way of an exploding airbag.</line><line>Further safety enhancements include front and side

door.</line><line>In the center grouping on the dash, arranged horizontally one above the other are audio controls up top, climate controls below.</line><line>Interior bins are adequate - no large atlases, fine for standard folding maps - and the trunk is cavernous.</line><line>A 60/40 split rear seat allows for longer parcels and items.</line><line>The LS Premium came with the DOHC, 24-valve, Duratec V6 engine.</line><line>Because of composite cam covers and intake manifold, it is 30 pounds lighter than the standard V6, yet cranks out 47 more horsepower.</line><line>Another sign of emerging quality: Tuneups come at 100,000-mile intervals.</line><line>The shift is a four-speed automatic with adaptive shift control, and in testing it ran itself up and down the gears smoothly and click-free.</line><line>Mercury, looking to lessen compartment noise, installed a lightweight instrument panel insulator, designed to absorb sound rather than just attempt to repel it.</line><line>The repel method can lead to vibrations and rattles, and the new insulation works quite well.</line><line>Engine noise was minimal, and even during rapid acceleration the engine - muffled through a single exhaust engineered to keep the same backflow as the dual system it replaces - was a distant burble.</line><line>Wind noise, however, was another matter, and it was so encompassing it was hard to tell if it was coming from mirrors, windows, or the sunroof.</line><line>The engine was plenty powerful - I'm not sure I'd be happy with the lesser mill in this car - and pulled the Sable up steep hills, and in and out of highway traffic, with confident surges.</line><line>My only performance complaint - and I've noticed this in other Ford Motor Co. products - is a strange lag time, while the car is already rolling, right after you press the accelerator.</line><line>It's as if the engine is getting the message and taking a split second to decode it.</line><line>The ride?</line><line>Big American again, though stiffer laterally than in the past.</line><line>Suspension front and rear is fully independent, with gas-pressurized struts and stabilizer bars.</line><line>This makes the Sable firm on corners (and made me wish again for better lateral support up the sides of the leather seats), and agile in commuter traffic.</line><line>What I did not like was the front-to-rear, up-and-down bounce that uneven roads produced.</line><line>Looking out the windshield at times was like looking over the bow of a gently bobbing boat under headway.</line><line>Given 200 horsepower in a front-wheel-drive auto, there was remarkably little indication of torque steer.</line><line>It was evident only in quick, sharp-turn starts from a stop, a move you don't really need to make.</line><line>On wet pavement, from a stop, rapid starts did produce a bit of chatter up front.</line><line>The power-assisted, ABS brakes - vented discs up front, drums in the rear - brought the car to sure, swift stops, even from 50 m.p.h.</line><line>At $23,000 for this model, Mercury is getting into the territory of some very fine, lower-level luxury cars and sports sedans.</line><line>There is no reason to exclude the Sable out of hand, but anyone looking to spend that much money should certainly do some comparison shopping.</line><line>--The multi-folding section between the front seats.</line><line>The lower portion folds out and down, revealing storage and cup holders; the upper folds down and becomes an armrest.</line><line>--The use of the dead space &quot;V&quot; at the lower front of the front windows to house parts of the speaker system.</line><line>This is usually wasted space behind the mirror mounts.</line><line>--The removable carpet pads, front and rear, are thin and cheap.</line><line>At $23,000, I'd want better.</line><line>--The fold-down armrest between the front seats could be split at the middle and hinged, opening for more

automakers as they install more advanced air-bag systems.&quot;</line><line>But Haseltine and others, including officials at General Motors, say there are privacy issues that have kept the technology from advancing as rapidly as it could have.</line><line>The data that a police investigator or insurance adjuster extracts from the car's air-bag control module could be translated into hard evidence for use in prosecution of a driver who is at fault in an accident, or for use by plaintiffs in lawsuits over such accidents, critics warn.</line><line>Vetronix says it is in negotiations with the California Highway Patrol to provide the devices to its officers, and the company plans to market the system aggressively to police agencies and insurance companies nationwide.</line><line>&quot;The capability to use this information in a intrusive manner is there, and we should all be vigilant to make sure nobody tries to do that,&quot; Haseltine said.</line><line>&quot;Manufacturers aren't putting these systems in vehicles with the intention that just anyone would be able to access the information.</line><line>&quot;Giving the technology to police investigators is a gray area,&quot; he said.</line><line>&quot;If a judge orders it in a court case, it can eventually wind up in court.</line><line>But it's likely that we will only see that in very serious crashes with expensive litigation.</line><line>I can't imagine using it for every little fender-bender.&quot;</line><line>General Motors has a &quot;strict policy that the data belongs to whoever owns or leases the vehicle, and it won't be accessed without their consent,&quot; said Terry Rhadigan, the automaker's safety spokesman.</line><line>But Vetronix promotes the system as something investigators can use almost immediately, at a crash site, to download the information, and there are concerns that such a situation sometimes might preclude getting a vehicle owner's permission.</line><line>The impetus to record this information to aid crash investigators came from the National Transportation Safety Board, which recommended in 1997 that automakers develop onboard collision-sensing and -recording devices.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="2" sums="32,5"/></line><line>The NTSB has long required that such equipment be installed on most modes of public transportation, including airliners, buses

Motors vehicles since 1990, but it has just been recently that the data from an air-bag deployment or near-deployment could be easily downloaded for use by investigators.</line><line>&quot;There is value to this data,&quot; GM's Rhadigan said.</line><line>&quot;The more we know about how our vehicles perform in the real world, the more we can improve them.</line><line>It's another way to aid in

obtained exclusive rights from GM to market a system to retrieve the data from those cars.</line><line>Those vehicles include the 1998 Buick Park Avenue and most '98 Cadillacs; most 1999 Buicks and Cadillacs, the Chevrolet Corvette and Camaro, and the Pontiac Firebird; and nearly all 2000 model Buicks, Cadillacs, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs, Chevrolet cars and trucks (including sport-utilities), GMC trucks and sport-utilities, the Isuzu Hombre pickup, and the Saturn S-series cars.</line><line>Other manufacturers, including the Ford Motor Co., have air-bag control modules that record the same information.</line><line>Vetronix says its system can be readily adapted to read the data from the other manufacturers' vehicles as soon as those automakers release the technical data necessary to develop the retrieval software.</line><line>Vetronix also plans to develop software in concert with GM to retrieve the data from air-bag-equipped GM cars dating to 1990, company officials said.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="22"/></line><line>For $2,495, Vetronix provides the crash data retrieval module and Windows-based software, along with the necessary cables to connect the device to the vehicle and a laptop computer.</line><line>The software puts the data into graphs that can be printed out, showing the vehicle's speed and other data for each of the five seconds preceding the air-bag deployment.</line><line>&quot;The potential impacts of this product are immense, since about 18,000 tow-away crashes occur daily,&quot; Zaleski said.</line><line>For now, the system is tied to the air-bag activation computer, and manufacturers such as GM don't see the technology evolving into a full-scale black box setup like that used in airliners, Rhadigan said.</line><line>In planes, there is a flight data recorder that keeps track of the aircraft's physical movements, and a separate cockpit voice recorder that picks up whatever the pilots say.</line><line>&quot;We see the automobile system used in just this air-bag application,&quot; Rhadigan said.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="10"/></line><line>&quot;We don't ever want
