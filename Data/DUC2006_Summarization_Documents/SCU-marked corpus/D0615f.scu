said Bitter.</line><line>&quot;When we get the standards from the state, we might have some other theories mentioned more, but I don't think we are going to have to teach creationism.&quot;</line><line>Maybe not.</line><line>But the teachers in Pratt may have to teach something closely akin to it.</line><line>Ten days before the state board's controversial vote, a small group of parents in Pratt appeared before the local school board and requested that a book titled &quot;Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins&quot; be included in the list of science textbooks to be considered for the proposed new curriculum.</line><line>On one level, it was a legitimate request by parents seeking input into what books should be used in the classrooms of their schools.</line><line>But coming, as it did, so close to the state board's decision, the request raised questions about whether Pratt, a town of about 7,000, will become one of the newest battlegrounds in a war that began nearly three-quarters of a century ago when a teacher in Tennessee by the name of John Scopes was convicted of the crime of teaching evolution.</line><line>That conviction was overturned and eventually led to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that teaching creationism violated the constitutional separation of church and state.</line><line>&quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; does not posit God as the creator.</line><line>It is ostensibly a textbook that promotes the theory of &quot;intelligent design,&quot; or the idea that life is so complex and miraculous that it could not have come about without the guidance of a master architect, or some intelligent force.</line><line>But it also is widely believed to be the textbook of the creationists who have tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce it to schoolbook lists in Idaho, Alabama and Texas and who have sold it to local school districts in several states.</line><line>The book is considered by the National Association of Biology Teachers, among others, to be little more than creation theory minus the &quot;creator.&quot;<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="5"/></line><line>Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of Wildlife and Parks who presented &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;

arguments that creation was accomplished 6,000 years ago.</line><line>Under the theory of evolution, rooted in a myriad of fossil, anatomic and genetic evidence, the scientific consensus is that life began on earth around 3.9 billion years ago, with humans and other species evolving from a common ancestor.</line><line>Ham has his own staff of scientists arguing to the contrary in heavily foot-noted monographs challenging the reliability of carbon-dating and other underpinnings of modern science.</line><line>&quot;I see a culture war hotting up in America between Christian morality and relative morality, which is really the difference between a creation-based philosophy and an evolution-based one,&quot; said Ham, who argues that if the word &quot;day&quot; in Genesis' account of creation is allowed to be taken metaphorically to encompass eons and to blur divinity's role, then the Bible is made fallible and morality reduced to human whim.</line><line>Whether or not America is ready for such a culture war of words, Ham is.</line><line>His group claims 140,000 on its mailing list and more than 3,000 visitors a day to its Web site at www.answersingenesis.org.</line><line>H says the organization is growing as political leaders are more tempted to tinker with accepted notions about evolution.</line><line>Supported by donations and fees on a wide array of handsomely produced recordings and publications, Answers in Genesis holds seminars across the country, offering counterarguments to evolution.</line><line>It offers not outright Christian fundamentalism, but &quot;a supplement to the church,&quot; in Ham's view.</line><line>Teachers who sponsor the creation clubs must sign a commitment to &quot;the inerrant word of God.&quot;</line><line>As a nonprofit group, his organization does not lobby government.</line><line>But it presents information to anyone who asks, and Ham happily claims that some Kansas officials involved in the curriculum decision are quite familiar with his publications.</line><line>&quot;I'm very encouraged,&quot;

as a dangerous anti-religion, a godless belief system that removed the Creator from creation and made his greatest idea, man, the grandchild of mere apes.</line><line>Over time, Darwin's ideas have prevailed.</line><line>Most mainstream religions have come to an accommodation with them, though a vocal minority still rejects evolution and propounds biblically-derived creationist theories.</line><line>The triumph of Darwin was the brilliant way the former ministry student distilled and explained the mechanism of life.</line><line>His thesis of descent with modification via natural selection immediately clicked with people who took the time to consider it.</line><line>So obvious was it to zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley that he exclaimed, &quot;How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.&quot;</line><line>But Darwin did not just cause readers to smack their heads and utter, &quot;Duh.&quot;</line><line>He fundamentally changed the way all of us - including every rejectionist, whether he admits it or not - see the world.</line><line>In &quot;Darwin's Ghost,&quot;

in this book, but here is a geneticist clearly alarmed at the dangers of genetic manipulation.</line><line>Already, he points out, beneficial genes inserted into oilseed rape to promote herbicide resistance have seeped into wild mustards and radishes.</line><line>&quot;Industry's optimism about the nature and stability of species is unfounded,&quot; he says.</line><line>&quot;Those who cast down the barriers to hybridism will soon be reminded of what evolution can do.&quot;</line><line>&quot;Darwin's Ghost&quot; is written with great authority and a fluid style, and it is refreshing not to have footnotes littering the text.</line><line>But Jones fails to include substantial back-of-the-book chapter notes to anchor disembodied quotes and expand upon interesting facts.</line><line>It is true that light or nonexistent footnotes are more the British than the American style, but combined with breezy writing the effect on a reader is an unnecessary wobbliness about facts.</line><line>Then there's the conceit of this book - the &quot;Darwin's ghost&quot; theme.</line><line>It is a little misleading.</line><line>Happily, Jones does not walk in Darwin's footsteps or retrace the voyage of the Beagle.</line><line>That would get old fast.</line><line>He properly honors Darwin throughout the book, but his republication of Darwin's chapter summaries and recapitulation seem contrived.</line><line>&quot;Origin&quot; is readily available (even on the Net).</line><line>Unannotated chunks of it do little good in this book.</line><line>Where Jones is especially good is in a quick putdown of some of the wilder claims of sociobiology.</line><line>&quot;Evolution is a political sofa that molds itself into the buttocks of the last to sit upon it,&quot; he notes.</line><line>Marxists and ultra-capitalists have both seized on it at times.</line><line>So, too, have agenda-driven scientists and journalists.</line><line>In a whack at the all-in-our-genes school, he says, &quot;Sexual fidelity or promiscuity seems, according to taste, the natural thing to do; families are often a joy, and patriotism arouses some, but we do not need natural selection to tell us why.&quot;</line><line>If Darwin had a ghost - a free-floating post-biological soul - it would enjoy that defense of his theory against the latest crop of misusers.</line></document><document name="NYT20000723.0019"><line>Don Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University, doesn't believe in evolution.</line><line>He doesn't (beginitalic)believe(enditalic) in gravity either.</line><line>If that sounds heretical for a man of science, Johanson says that evolution is &quot;not a matter of belief.</line><line>It's a matter of fact.&quot;</line><line>Evolution, which explains how plant and animal species arise and why we have diversity among species, is the keystone of modern biology.</line><line>It is one of the most widely accepted notions in science, ranking alongside gravity, the heliocentric view of the solar system (planets revolve around the sun) and the roundness of Earth.</line><line>Yet some doubters, mostly in America, reject the principles proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin and detailed in his 1859 treatise (beginitalic)On the Origin of Species.</line><line>(enditalic) Darwin said that life on Earth began with simple organisms and evolved into more sophisticated species over many thousands of years through a process called natural selection.<annotation scu-count="3" sum-count="1" sums="14"><scu uid="83" label="According to evolutionists, scientific evidence shows that life began with simple organisms" weight="2"/><scu uid="84" label="Humans and all other forms of life evolved gradually over millions of years" weight="2"/><scu uid="53" label="Evolution science holds that all species, including humans, arose through natural selection" weight="1"/></annotation></line><line>Species adapt to their environment and pass on genetic characteristics to their offspring.</line><line>To proponents of creationism, the universe was created by God through a process set forth in the first book of the Bible, Genesis.</line><line>God created all species simultaneously, the world was completed in six days and humans descended from Adam and Eve - not earlier primates.</line><line>This month marks the 75th anniversary of the most celebrated debate between those theories - the Scopes &quot;monkey&quot;

does not mean &quot;guess,&quot; she says.</line><line>Scientists define theory as a series of provable facts, an organizing framework that has predictions and is testable.</line><line>Darwin was not the first scientist to shake the faithful.</line><line>In the 16th century, Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forth the startling notion that the Earth revolved around the sun, instead of the reverse.</line><line>Alarmed citizens of the Earth feared that God would not be able to find them if their planet were constantly moving.</line><line>To remove Earth from the center of the solar system was disturbing enough, but then Darwin removed humans from the center of the animal kingdom.</line><line>The Bible taught that man was given dominion over the creatures of the Earth.</line><line>Darwin's ideas instead put man on a par with every creature from gnats to whales.</line><line>Darwin, who followed the tenets of the Church of England as well as Unitarianism, was a reluctant prophet.</line><line>Knowing his findings would be unsettling, he published his research only at the urging of his wife.</line><line>At the same time, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel was developing rudimentary theories of genetics, though they would largely be ignored until scientists rediscovered his work around 1900.</line><line>The field of genetics took root in the 1930s, building on Darwin's studies and reinforcing evidence seen but not yet explained.</line><line>While some people find belief in a divine creator easier than understanding genes and chromosomes, Goldstein sees science and faith as compatible.</line><line>He equates God's work with the forces of nature and sees the Bible not as a scientific textbook but as a metaphor.</line><line>&quot;I believe the Bible is God-inspired,&quot; Goldstein says.</line><line>&quot;To believe in God doesn't mean you have to believe in creationism.&quot;</line><line>To endorse creationism, he says, is to deny nearly all scientific fields, including geology, astronomy, biology, physics and chemistry.</line><line>And to deny the elegant workings of evolution is to miss the beauty of such a grand mechanism.</line><line>&quot;I feel sorry for them,&quot;
