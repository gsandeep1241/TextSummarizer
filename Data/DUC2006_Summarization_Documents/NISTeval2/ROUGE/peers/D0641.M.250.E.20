Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global warming to changes in circulation patterns.
The two alternating states have markedly different effects on weather.
The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects of global warming on El Nino's frequency.
The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might have a similar effect.
Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global warming.
McKelvey said the team's ultimate aim was to show the likely effect of future global warming.
