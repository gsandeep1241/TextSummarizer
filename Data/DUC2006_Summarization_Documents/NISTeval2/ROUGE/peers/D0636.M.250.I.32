GM's new strategy, and particularly plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich.
Four out of every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the UAW's grip on the industry.

Key issues in talks are certain to include job security, particularly for workers at auto parts subsidiaries, as well as modest changes and other employee benefits.
