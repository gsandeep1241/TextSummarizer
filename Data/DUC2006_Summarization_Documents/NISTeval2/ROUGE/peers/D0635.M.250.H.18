George W. Bush confronts yet another closely scrutinized death penalty case this week, the immediate decision before him is one that has become remarkably familiar over the course of 134 executions in Texas during his five and a half years in office: whether or not to use his limited power to halt the next one.
Because of the stakes involved, the emotions it stirs and the welling questions about the fairness of its administration, the death penalty has become one of the tests of Bush's seriousness, a quality he arguably comes by less easily than his levity or spunk.
Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas governor's powers generally, he may have little or no discretion over Graham's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles renders its ruling on the matter this week.
Karen P. Hughes, a spokesman for Bush, said Thursday afternoon that McGinn's case was the first one Bush has faced as governor in which the possibility of further DNA testing was so central to the question of innocence or guilt.
Bush's embrace of DNA testing for death row inmates, which he never advocated in Texas, comes as some parts of the nation have seen a rethinking of capital punishment amid concerns about the execution of innocent prisoners and polls that indicate support for the death penalty is at a 20-year low, although most Americans still favor it.
