In the past few years, China's law enforcement authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs which entered China from overseas.
Following the promulgation and enforcement of the Administrative Procedure Law and the Law on State Compensation, in March of 1996, China promulgated the Law on Administrative Punishment, thus standardizing in terms of system the act of administrative punishment by the governments, the white paper says.
It points out that China has paid close attention to standardizing the practice of administrative and law-enforcement departments, so as to protect the citizens' legitimate rights from any infringement.
In 1996, public security and judicial departments launched, according to law, a severe nationwide crack down on criminal offenses seriously endangering public security, such as homicides, robberies, rape, kidnapping and blackmail, and major theft, with emphasis placed on crimes involving the use of guns, crimes with gangster connections and characteristics, and crimes committed by rogue and vicious social forces, it says.
Zhang said that China amended its Criminal Law recently to enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering, terrorist crime, trafficking of illegal immigrants and environment-related crimes.
Zhang Fusen, head of the Chinese delegation, told the fifth session of the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) that China will participate in United Nations activities in crime prevention and criminal justice.
