The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1 / 2 years, will continue to take photos Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by robotic space probes, scientists said at an all-day seminar on the latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
Kivelson said that if the full Galileo mission extension was approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this same type of phenomenon occurred on Ganymede, which is the largest moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet Mercury.
Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have concluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is similar to that on Earth - only more so - but is generated by heat from a completely different source : from deep in the planet, not from sunlight.
