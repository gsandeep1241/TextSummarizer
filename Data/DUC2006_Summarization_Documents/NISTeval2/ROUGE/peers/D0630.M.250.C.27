With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of Internet bookstores, gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big Macs: fast, cheap and wrapped to go.
The announcement this month that the nation's leading bookseller, Barnes & Noble, will buy the leading wholesaler, the Ingram Book Group, for $600 million is just the latest move in a shifting field of distribution networks.
Ingram, based in Nashville, is the dominant force in book distribution.
Barnes & Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the consumer book market.
For the independent booksellers, the worst fears are that a new book conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes & Noble could ultimately affect issues like credit, speed of delivery and access to popular titles that are in short supply.
Since the early 1990s, bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less than 3,500, much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion.
On the eve of its annual national convention, the bookselling business has never seemed more like a business.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions.
Such top booksellers as Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com are looking for ways to make electronic commerce profitable and competitive by sending more of their orders through their own distribution centers.
