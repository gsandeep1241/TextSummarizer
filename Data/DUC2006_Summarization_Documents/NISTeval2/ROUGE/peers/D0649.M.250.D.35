The Central Electoral Commission approved Zyuganov's candidacy in a unanimous vote Tuesday after reviewing the required 500,000 signatures of support he had submitted, commission spokesman Artyom Golev said.
With his standing in the polls dipping, acting President Vladimir Putin urged voters Saturday to elect him with a clear majority to avoid a second round, but denied that he's worried about winning.
Recent polls show support for Putin down by 2 to 3 percentage points compared to the 60 percent he had received in recent weeks.
While Putin would almost certainly win a second round, it would have been a humbling setback for the former KGB officer who has soared from nowhere to become the nation's most popular politician in a few months.
A string of victories in parliament have solidified President Vladimir Putin's authority and appear to be setting the stage for a calmer, more conciliatory era in Russia after the frenzied confusion of the Boris Yeltsin years.
But overall, observers predict Putin will probably have little trouble getting what he wants whatever that turns out to be.
A reclusive figure who rarely speaks in public, Putin has a reputation for near absolute loyalty to his superiors.
St. Petersburg, Russia - Today the law school campus at the old Leningrad State University, which is located on the 22nd Line of Vasilyevsky Island, is dotted with cozy little cafes and restaurants.
Certainly, Putin has moved cautiously since winning the election on Sunday.
