In New York's Queens borough, where the first cases of encephalitis were reported the CDC and the city's health department planned to take blood samples door-to-door, with 300 households selected at random and on a voluntary basis.
New Jersey Health Commissioner Christine Grant said residents should take precautions against mosquito bites but should not be ``unduly concerned'' by the test results.
Blood samples taken from 43 test chickens stationed in every county have proved negative for the virus, according to Grant.
Cdc takes seriously its leadership role in preparing for emerging infectious disease outbreaks and continues to work to keep Americans safe and healthy,'' the statement read.
On those rare occasions when they do detect a zebra, doctors say they need to take extra steps in their investigation to make sure they have identified the right one.
The change in diagnosis, though not important in terms of the spraying and other public health measures taken to combat the outbreak, was scientifically embarrassing to the cdc, the premier federal agency that is responsible for tracking infectious diseases in this country.
There can be considerable overlap in findings from the laboratory tests unless extra steps are taken to distinguish between the many types of encephalitis-causing arboviruses.
West Nile-related pesticide spraying has also taken place, or is scheduled, in Liverpool and in Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island, where officials reported on that the virus had been confirmed in 13 samples of infected mosquitoes collected on 17 and in 12 additional birds.
