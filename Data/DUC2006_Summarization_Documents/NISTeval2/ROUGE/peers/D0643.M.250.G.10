El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns.
La Nina is currently taking place.
Studies have disagreed on whether the warming would produce the El-Nino-like Pacific surface temperatures.
The 1997-98 El Nino meant record rain in California, heavy.
According to WMO, strong warm episode conditions have persisted in the tropical Pacific since July 1997.
During La Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and flooding and rains return to Asia.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
Without either, weather becomes typical _ meaning largely unpredictable _ meteorologists say.
The center predicted that after rapid cooling during the summer, ocean temperatures would rebound before cooling again.
It will be years before these forces are incorporated in official forecasts issued by federal climate prediction centers.
Israeli scientists have achieved progress in predicting the chaotic behavior of El Nino, a warming of surface water of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, through a sophisticated computer simulation.
LOS ANGELES -- Despite predictions that La Nina would bring Los Angeles a dry winter and possibly worsen the fire season, the weather phenomenon now appears to be losing strength, according to scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
``El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time,'' said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate Prediction Center.
The good news is that they can now
