PARIS _ Air France said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines because it believes a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July.
French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff.
All 109 people aboard were killed as well as five on the ground.
Air France issued a one-paragraph statement on its lawsuit, saying it had been filed in the Pontoise commercial court, which covers the town of Gonesse, where the plane had dropped onto a small wooden hotel.
The statement said that under the civil aviation legal code, an airline is responsible for damage caused by any pieces that fall off its aircraft.
Three weeks ago, Continental acknowledged that a strip of metal found on the runway among debris from the plane was similar in shape to a piece missing from its DC-10, which had been heading for New Jersey just minutes before the doomed Concorde took off.
French investigators believe the strip shredded one of the Concorde's tires, sending huge chunks of rubber through the jet's fuel tanks.
Continental issued a brief statement on Wednesday, saying that there was not proof that it was linked to the crash.
