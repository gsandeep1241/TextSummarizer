If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton pontoons, navy officials said.
Russian officials say they are focusing on indications that the Kursk collided with an underwater object, possibly a foreign submarine.
U.S. officials have said that two American submarines were in the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included the Kursk.
Russian officials said the Kursk was not carrying nuclear weapons.
U.S. officials have said the Kursk's sinking was most likely caused by the misfiring of one of its torpedoes.
The navy said some sections of the Kursk are flooded.
Therefore, it will not be lowered to the submarine Kursk.
``The projection of possible consequences of the accident in the Kursk for the lives of its crew remains extremely grave,'' the Russian navy commander, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said Tuesday.
