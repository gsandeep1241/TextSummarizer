The Kursk was examined by a bell-shaped deep-water apparatus late Monday and a decision on how to conduct a rescue would likely be made Tuesday, according to Russian news reports.
Oxygen supplies were running low and were expected to run out in about two days, said one of the submarine's designers, according to the Russian news agency Interfax.
Faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to media reports.
Rumors about the sailors trapped in a crippled Russian submarine on the sea floor circulate constantly in the offices, shops and homes of this Arctic port that glories in its ties to the navy.
They have said that neither submarine was close to the Russian vessel.
Russian officials maintain that the Kursk collided with a large object such as a foreign submarine, or with a World War II mine, but they have also considered the possibility that a torpedo inside the submarine misfired.
A Russian general claimed Monday that rescuers located an object near the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk that resembled equipment from a U.S. or British ship, but a navy spokesman denied any such discovery.
Russian officials have also not ruled out that the Kursk hit a World War II-era mine.
The contracts are with the Norwegian company Stolt Offshore, whose divers were able to open the hatch of sunken submarine Kursk after Russian efforts failed for days.
