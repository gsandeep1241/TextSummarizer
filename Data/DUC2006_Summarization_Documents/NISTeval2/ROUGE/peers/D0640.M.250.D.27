The "Kursk", with a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and able to dive to an depth of up to 500 meters, was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.
The multipurpose submarine went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on Sunday while attending a routine exercise of the Russian Northern Fleet.
The cause of the accident remains unknown, but Moscow says a collision with another object or an explosion in the first compartment of the submarine as among the most probable scenarios.
But the Russian side turned down the offer, AFP quoted officials at the headquarters of the chief of general staff of the French armed forces as saying.
The Norwegian and British teams were brought to the disaster site by two Norwegian ships which moved into position above the mangled Kursk before dawn.
Earlier Monday, the Norwegian divers opened the emergency hatch of Kursk's ninth compartment at 7:45 a.m. Moscow time (0345 GMT), and nobody was found in the docking area, which is flooded, Russian Northern Fleet commander Vyacheslav Popov told the RTR state television.
The evacuation of the 116-man crew of "Kursk" begun Tuesday afternoon.
Pressure-measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the rescue team an idea about conditions inside the Kursk.
Three submarines and five submersible attack vessels have come to its rescue.
Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vyacheslav Popov is overseeing the rescue operation, which is aimed at raising the submarine to the surface and evacuating its crew.
