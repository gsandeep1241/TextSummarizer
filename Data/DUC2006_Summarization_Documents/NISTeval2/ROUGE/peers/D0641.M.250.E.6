``The question is, `What is the cause of it'''?
The ``consensus'' among scientists, it is said, is that the planet's temperature is rising, the cause of the rise is the use of fossil fuels, and disastrous climate changes are looming unless drastic changes are made.
The scientists, led by Ye Duzheng, an aerophysicist and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the increase rate of gases that cause the greenhouse effect will accelerate, so much so that the earth's warming trend will continue in the coming dozens of years.
They said that the changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of global warming.
``We are spending millions of dollars to rehabilitate the devastation caused by the adverse effects of climate change''.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
That they have not, Dr. Richard S said, suggests that ``what's happening at the surface is not related to the greenhouse effect''.
The scientists said that the warming effect, especially rising temperatures in winter, will result in a series of changes to nature and human society.
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European community said that one ton of methane will have the same warming effect as 56 tons of carbon dioxide over a period of 20 years.
