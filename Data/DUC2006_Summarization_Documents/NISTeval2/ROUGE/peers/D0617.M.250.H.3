Cruising at 33,000 feet, EgyptAir Flight 990 was " uneventful " until the plane 's autopilot disconnected about 8 seconds the jetliner, with 217 people aboard, began to toward the Atlantic Ocean. The 767 has a modern "glass cockpit," and information about the plane, including its altitude and attitude (or angle of flight), are displayed on screens in front of the crew.
An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed.
It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
Speculation about a possible hijacking, has lingered the flight data recorder the plane 's autopilot was turned off, the aircraft put into a dive, the throttles cut back and the engines shut off . In November, with no evidence the crash was an accident, Hall was prepared to turn the investigation over to the FBI further fueling the theory of pilot suicide when the Egyptian government strenuously objected .
