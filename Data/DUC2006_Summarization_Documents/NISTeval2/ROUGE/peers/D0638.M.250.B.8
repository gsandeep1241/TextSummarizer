Galileo took measurements of Europa's magnetic field during a flyby 218 miles above the moon.
Galileo measured Europa's magnetic fields in an effort to detect disturbances beneath the moon's icy crust.
Galileo, which arrived at Jupiter, is not scheduled to make any more encounters of Europa.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
Photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft show that Jupiter's moon Io is aglow with colorful light.
Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites.
Despite these slight similarities to Earth, Jupiter and its moons are far stranger than anything seen on this planet.
Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system _ has earthlike aspects.
Washington (AP) _ Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself.
The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
The probe has detected a large hole in the...
