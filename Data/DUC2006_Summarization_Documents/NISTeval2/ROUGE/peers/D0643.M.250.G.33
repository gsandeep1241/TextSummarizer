GENEVA (AP) _ The surface of the Pacific Ocean is expected to continue cooling slowly for the rest of the year, fueling the La Nina weather phenomenon, the U.N. weather agency said Monday.
``Weak La Nina conditions'' have started to develop, the World Meteorological Organization said in its El Nino/La Nina Update.
The change in the weather was, of course, the work of El Nino.
The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance.
For many parts of the Americas and Asia, the occasional warming and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in, usually with little warning, then staying for months or sometimes a year or two, bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of storms and droughts, heat and cold.
The meeting will provide scientific and technical information on the current status of El Nino, as one of the major forces acting on the global climate system and with a potential to affect weather patterns in many areas of the globe.
On the past effects of El Nino, he said that after it occurred in 1972-73, El Nino reversed to trigger floods in 1974, in 1982-83 it reversed into a spate of flooding, and again in 1986, El Nino led to the worst flooding when it reversed in 1987 and 1988
