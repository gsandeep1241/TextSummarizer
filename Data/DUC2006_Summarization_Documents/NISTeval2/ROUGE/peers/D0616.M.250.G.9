Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said Friday the government is tightening security on the border with Chechnya, to guard against possible terrorist attacks.
Preliminary reports indicate that 36 Russian servicemen were killed and another 74 injured in five terrorist attacks in Chechnya on Sunday, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced here Monday.
Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks.
Russian federal forces continued air raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks during the May holidays.
They detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to re-enter Chechnya, Russian media reported Saturday.
The latest report shows that the casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached over 100, said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
He said about 12,000 to 15,000 militants have remained in Chechnya, including some 2000 terrorists and bandits backed by foreign extremists, adding that "this terrorist army will have to be eliminated unless the bandits surrender and lay down their arms.
