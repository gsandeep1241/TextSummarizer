It provides evidence that the energy source driving Jupiter's circulation is ``probably heat escaping from the deep interior of the planet,'' said Dr. The probe found that lighting occurs on Jupiter only about one-tenth as often as on Earth, which is consistent with the absence of water clouds but reduces the possibility of finding organic molecules in the Jovian atmosphere.
Asked about the meaning of these findings, the project scientists said that the probe's measurements may necessitate a reappraisal of existing views of how Jupiter evolved from the solar nebula, because most scientists believe now that Jupiter has a composition similar to that of the gas and dust cloud of the primitive solar nebula from which the planets and the Sun were formed.
``Until now, we thought Callisto was a dead and boring moon, just a hunk of rock and ice,'' said space physicist Margaret Kivelson of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has been using Galileo's magnetometer to measure electric currents flowing from Jupiter for nearly three years.
Within five years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
Since the solar concentration should reflect the composition of the warm, inner portion of the solar nebula he said, the overall results were unexpected.
