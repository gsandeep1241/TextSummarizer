According to the center ' s Dr. Wang Zhanggui, El Nino is related to sunspot activity, and generally occurs four to five years after a period of little sunspot activity, which was the case last year, when there was strong El Nino activity. La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold . `` El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time, '' said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service ' s Climate Prediction Center . The world was also warmer in that quiet El Nino period, further pointing to a possible relationship between El Nino and global warming . The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world ' s weather months in advance . In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University ' s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory . Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided .
