WASHINGTON (AP) - Employees earning the federal minimum wage over a 40-hour week cannot afford what the federal government considers a ''modest'' two-bedroom apartment in any county in the nation, according to a study released Wednesday.
Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which favors raising the minimum wage, demonstrates the flip side of the booming economy.
''Affordable housing is out of reach for many Americans, especially the lowest-income workers because rents continue to increase dramatically, while the minimum wage has not,'' he said.
New York ranked fifth worst among the states when it came to high rents.
Residents in the Empire State need to earn $16.04 an hour to pay rent.
Not surprisingly, the highest rents are in the New York City area, Westchester County and Long Island where ''fair market rents'' ranged from $949 to $1,173.
The study used the Department of Housing and Urban Development's definition of ''fair market rent'' to determine the hourly wage needed to pay for an average apartment in each state, county and metropolitan area.
HUD says people should not spend more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing.
Using that standard, no one who works a 40-hour week and makes $5.15 per hour can afford an average rent in any county, according to the coalition.
While rents in New York City and the surrounding suburbs were high, California and Connecticut led the pack.
