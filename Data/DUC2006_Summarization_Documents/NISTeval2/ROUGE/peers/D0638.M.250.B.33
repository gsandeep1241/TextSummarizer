The power causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of Jupiter and pictures from Galileo show the moon with a glimmering halo.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
Within five years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
Asked about the meaning of these findings, the project scientists said that the probe's measurements may necessitate a reappraisal of existing views of how Jupiter evolved from the solar nebula, because most scientists believe now that Jupiter has a composition similar to that of the gas and dust cloud of the primitive solar nebula from which the planets
