The deal divides up salmon among the two countries' fishermen only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon.
Hatcheries have been part of the Pacific salmon equation since 1872, when the U.S. Fish Commission built the first one on the McCloud River in Northern California.
``The no-net-loss policy applies to spring, summer and fall chinook, sockeye salmon, steelhead and coho salmon if the tribes successfully re-introduce this species,'' said Bill Dobbins, manager of the Douglas County PUD.
The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act.
The scientists' effort, called the Program for Analysis and Testing of Hypotheses (PATH), analyzed options for improving salmon and steelhead survival in the lower Snake River.
Washington agreed last June to restrict the recreational catch of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British Columbia, and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound for the Stuart River.
The plan governs all species of salmon and steelhead, from the relatively healthy sockeye salmon runs of Lake Osoyoos and Lake Wenatchee to the endangered spring chinook salmon.
In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 20 of the 26 salmon populations listed under the ESA are threatened.
