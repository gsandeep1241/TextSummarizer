Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system _ has earthlike aspects.
(AP) -- NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
Galileo, orbiting Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue taking photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year.
Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
Are there any planets in our solar system with no moons at all?
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
The space shuttle Atlantis was launched on a five-day mission that included deployment of the Galileo space probe on a course for Jupiter.
