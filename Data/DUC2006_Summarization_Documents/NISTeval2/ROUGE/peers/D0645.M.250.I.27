The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 per year or less, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4-million margin in 1995, the latest year for which data was available.
The public housing bill has been pressed mainly by congressional Republicans over the opposition of Democrats and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who have said that the Republican bill would leave poor people without housing.
But Cuomo has negotiated changes in the bill that have made it acceptable to many Democrats.
Cuomo is also on the verge of winning enactment of two other housing measures that are likely to make it easier for congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration to accept the public housing bill.
Congress last fall passed reforms intended to discourage the use of public housing projects as warehouses for the very poor.
The Clinton administration has sought to increase the supply of affordable housing units, requesting 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget.
But it is far from certain if Congress will approve such a measure.
For New York and other housing authorities, the changes would free officials to set aside hundreds of more vacant units each year for families making as much as $40,000 a year.
