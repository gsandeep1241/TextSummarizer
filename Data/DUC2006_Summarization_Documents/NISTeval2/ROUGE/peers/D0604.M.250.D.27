And starting April 30, Denver will host the Lucasfilm Ltd.-sanctioned ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a three-day fan festival at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum with ``Phantom Menace'' sneak peeks, appearances by many of the film's stars, including young Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a.
Darth Vader), and a marketplace hawking merchandise from all the ``Star Wars'' films.
Die-hard fans who turned out for a Star Wars convention in Denver on Friday got a sneak-peek at some of the merchandise.
There were eight basic action figures, which are 3 3/4 inches tall, including the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young man; Anakin Skywalker, the father of Luke Skywalker and the man who later became Darth Vader; Jar Jar Binks, a new space creature; and Queen Amidala, the leader of the ``good'' side.
In addition to being treated to never-before-screened scenes from the closely guarded film, audience members could attend question-and-answer sessions with many who worked on the film, including Jake Lloyd (who plays Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father and the future Darth Vader), Ray Park (the villain Darth Maul), Rick McCallum (the movie's producer), Anthony Daniels (the voice of C-3P0) and Pernilla August (Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker).
In short, there's a lot that's eye-filling in ``The Phantom Menace,'' but not much that's brain-filling, and nobody is going to think of it as soul food.
Its high point isn't even the space or land battles one has come to expect of ``Star Wars''.
