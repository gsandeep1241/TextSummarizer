Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there.
He said the militants were planning "a number of terrorist acts on the territory of Chechnya" at the end of the month, but for the moment were concentrating on "quick attacks" on Russian checkpoints.
Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to cross into Chechnya.
Putin said Islamic militants, who twice invaded neighboring Dagestan from Chechnya this summer, were planning new attacks on chemical and nuclear power plants in Russia, as well as on Russia's transportation network.
Raduyev intended to target Russian nuclear facilities, while Basayev was training women militants to carry out attacks in southern Russia, the ministry claimed, without citing any evidence.
Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of Chechnya's capital of Grozny, then pulled back to about three miles inside the border.
Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be forced to launch "retaliatory strikes" in surrounding Russian regions.
