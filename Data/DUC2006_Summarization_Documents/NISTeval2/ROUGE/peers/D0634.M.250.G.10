SEATTLE _ Once-abundant salmon runs of Canada's west coast have suffered drastic declines in recent years due to habitat destruction, overfishing and changes in ocean conditions, the Vancouver-based Pacific Fisheries Resource Council found in its first report.
Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks.
200 scientists signed a letter drafted by an Idaho environmental group to save salmon and steelhead runs.
In 1994, Canada's fisheries ministry slapped a $1,100 on Alaska-bound U.S. fishing boats.
