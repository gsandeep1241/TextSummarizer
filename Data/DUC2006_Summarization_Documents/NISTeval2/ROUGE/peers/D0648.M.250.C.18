Hollander and his colleagues wanted to be sure clomipramine was producing improvements in the behavior of people with body dysmorphic disorder, and that the patients were not improving simply because they knew they were getting treatment and therefore expected themselves to improve.
So the researchers compared clomipramine with another drug, desipramine, which had similar side effects but does not affect serotonin.
The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Paxil, a popular treatment for depression and panic or obsessive-compulsive disorders, for treating what is sometimes called social phobia may conjure up images of a pill that will calm your jitters before speaking in public or meeting strangers at a cocktail party.
However, Pollack of the MGH said the much greater danger is not that people will try to abuse Paxil, but that people with social anxiety disorder will not seek help ``when they have something that is treatable, and they can do better and function better in life.'' It may not really be necessary for law enforcement to intervene between the two disciplines, but there is nevertheless a ``great divide'' that must be closed if research and treatment are to advance more quickly, says a group of Harvard scientists from both fields.
In an article published Tuesday in the journal Neurology, researchers say the animosity of the past stems from a difference of thinking about what causes disease _ the biology of the brain vs. the psychiatry of the mind.
