The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender''.
The gang's most spectacular crime came in 1996, police now say, by kidnapping the son of one of Hong Kong's richest businessmen and getting away with a staggering $125 million in ransom.
Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were from mainland China, Zhang said.
Zhang Fusen, head of the Chinese delegation, told the fifth session of the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) that China will participate in United Nations activities in crime prevention and criminal justice.
Most of the crimes allegedly were planned in China, but committed in Hong Kong.
In July, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery.
