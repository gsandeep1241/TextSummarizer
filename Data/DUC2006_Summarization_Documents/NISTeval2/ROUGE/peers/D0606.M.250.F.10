Global change is now a certainty.
Scientists maintain a climate shift was at work.
Long-term climate change such as global warming could have major impacts on human health, the environment, the economy and society, said Dr. James Baker, Director of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
At the same time, agriculture are playing a significant role in altering the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
As a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the frequency and severity of drought could increase across the region.
On Friday global warming resulted in the rise in incidence of malaria.
This could result in a sudden, long-term drop in the North Atlantic region's temperature.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
The UNEP official noted that sustained increase in mean ambient temperatures beyond one centigrade degree would cause significant changes in forest and rangeland cover, species distribution, composition and migration patterns, and biome distribution.
The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming.
As a result, the number of plankton and fish will change as the marine ecosystem is disrupted.
Some scientists argue it reflects broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but others say
