Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said Friday the government is tightening security on the border with Chechnya, to guard against possible terrorist attacks.
Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to cross into Chechnya.
Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
The Chechens have most of the territory in the more heavily populated regions south of the river, though the Russians have made inroads in western Chechnya and have been massing forces along Chechnya's eastern border.
He said the militants were planning " a number of terrorist acts on the territory of Chechnya " at the end of the month, but for the moment were concentrating on " quick attacks " on Russian checkpoints.
Chechen rebels committed five terrorist blasts in several key cities of the war-torn republic Sunday night, killing at least 36 Russian servicemen and wounding 74, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced.
Preliminary reports indicate that 36 Russian servicemen were killed and another 74 injured in five terrorist attacks in Chechnya on Sunday, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced here Monday.
Chechen rebels have staged a fresh wave of terrorists acts since Russian troops launched a large-scale mopping-up campaign against the militants in late June, especially after federal units annihilated a 200-250 strong gang of Arab mercenaries near central Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt last
