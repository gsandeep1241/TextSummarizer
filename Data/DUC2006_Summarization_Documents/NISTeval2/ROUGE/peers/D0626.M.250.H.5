Nearly simultaneous bombings at U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug. 7 killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 5,500 people.
Investigators in the Aug. 7 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had made ``great strides,'' having already determined what the bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy.
A magistrate Monday granted a prosecution request to release into police custody one of two suspects charged in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy to assist in the investigation for five days.
In June and July, the indictment says, the suspects in Tanzania bought a 1987 Nissan Atlas truck to carry the bomb to the embassy, and a white Suzuki Samurai, in which the suspects would flee.
The suspects arranged for welding and other mechanical work to be done on the truck, apparently to equip it to carry the bomb, the indictment says.
They also were said to have bought oxygen and acetylene tanks and two large truck batteries.
Experts say these are typically used to augment the ignition and explosion of a bomb.
The newspaper identified the witness as one of the two privately employed security guards working at the embassy gate at the time of the bombing.
In interviews Saturday, intelligence and law enforcement officials who asked not to be identified said there had not been positive identification of the suspect, who was described as a relatively low-level member of Bin Laden's circle. U.S.
