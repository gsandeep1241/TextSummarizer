A critical one is that the CDC can no longer be certain that the West Nile virus has never been present in the United States, because federal scientists never specifically checked for it in earlier outbreaks and individual cases.
Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and Europe, never before in the United States.
Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying now under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus.
The West Nile virus -- never before recorded in the Western Hemisphere -- probably entered the United States in infected birds.
That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the United States until August; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
They warn that the Gulf coast of the United States will probably see the next outbreak of West Nile virus.
Q. Can you get West Nile virus directly from birds?
This will be the case in the United States for years to come, scientists suggest.
Not everyone is so emotional about the West Nile virus.
An 82-year-old New Jersey man has become the first person in the United States this year to die of the West Nile virus, Gov. Christie Whitman said Wednesday.
