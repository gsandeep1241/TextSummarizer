Welcome to the all-new, awe-inspiring, way-cool Volvo S80 sedan, the biggest and best and least Volvo-looking Volvo of all time.
This vehicle is so important for Volvo's future _ the company's first serious attempt to built a prestige vehicle based on the traditional Volvo safety and durability _ that about 25,000 dealers and Volvo employees from around the world have been brought to the Gothenburg headquarters during the past several weeks to learn about the S80, according to officials of Volvo Cars of North America.
THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five-passenger, inline six-cylinder- powered, front-drive sedan, an all-new vehicle that will serve as Volvo's flagship car around the world.
China's automotive industry is working with foreign manufacturers to improve the safety records of Chinese-made vehicles, according to today's China Daily.
Leif Engstorm, chief representative of Volvo's China operations, said: ``As the pioneer of auto safety innovation, we feel it is our responsibility to work closely with Chinese partners and safety experts to exchange views and technology.'' Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment.
``It is time for all modes of transportation to realize the unlimited potential that recorder technology has to offer, both in terms of economics and safety,'' he said at a board conference last month.
