``But when he talks about bringing together his famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend our country,'' Chretien said.
Bouchard is intent on avoiding a third defeat, and won a power struggle with party hard-liners earlier this year by insisting he would call another referendum only if opinion polls showed the separatists would win.
The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols.
``The result tonight... reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success,'' said Charest, who will serve as opposition leader in the provincial legislature.
Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
At the core of the Acadian argument against separation for Quebec is their own history and the event that defined them -- the deportation of 10,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia by Britain beginning in 1755 for refusing to swear allegiance to the queen.
