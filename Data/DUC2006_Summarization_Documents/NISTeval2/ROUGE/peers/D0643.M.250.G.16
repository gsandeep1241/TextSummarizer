Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on South African weather, and that earlier forecasts for dry conditions from November to March were correct.
It was an indication that global weather patterns were being disturbed by an El Niono event, the bureau said.
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanographers today expect climatic repercussions on global weather as El Nino is expected to come sometime this year or the next.
DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is studying the effects of El Nino in order to develop a model to help farmers understand the global weather pattern when the ocean current in the Pacific coast off Peru warms up or cools down, a press report said Monday.
Without either, weather becomes typical _ meaning largely unpredictable _ meteorologists say.
He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success.
``This La Nina provides the physical link between many of the unusual weather patterns seen in far-flung parts of the globe,'' said John Janowiak, a scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
El Nino, which involves the equatorial waters in the Pacific warming up, creating unusual weather patterns around the world, increased winter temperatures in Lima by about 4 degrees centigrade (about 7 degrees Fahrenheit).
Global Warming Might Spur El Nino
