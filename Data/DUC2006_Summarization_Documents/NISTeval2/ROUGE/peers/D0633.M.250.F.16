ALBANY, N.Y.
_ Borrowing from a crime-fighting tool used in New York City, Gov. George Pataki has announced a pilot program designed to help counties share crime data, map trends and nab more criminals.
That week, and the following one, the front pages of New York's tabloids _ where crime once was king _ were taken up with the Knicks' playoff chances, new cancer drugs and the final episode of ``Seinfeld.'' Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are influencing the nation's crime rate.
Currently, there are 40 million children under the age of 10 nationwide.
``We've got crime going in one direction, and social policy going in the other,'' said Dr. Allen Beck, the Justice Department's lead statistician on criminal justice trends.
Nationwide studies show that when police enforce the curfew, crime drops, said Daniel Glaser, a University of Southern California professor who specializes in juvenile crime and crime prevention.
``It's easy to attribute crime drops to things like the curfew, but it's really jobs and the economy that play a big role,'' she said.
``Clearly Texas was right to develop strong laws for dealing with criminal activities and strong laws covering juvenile crime to let them know that there are consequences for their behavior,'' said Bush press aide Mike Jones.
LOS ANGELES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- California and the rest of the United States have reported continuing drop in crime rates, but it seems difficult for police as well as criminologists to explain why.
