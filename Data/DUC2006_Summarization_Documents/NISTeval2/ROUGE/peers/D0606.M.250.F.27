Oyuela said the global mean surface temperature over the past one hundred years has climbed by 0.6 centigrades, with a rise in the sea level of between 10-25 centimeters.
Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres.
Huge tracts of Earth's surface could disappear under rising oceans, creating millions of "environmental refugees," British climate scientist John Houghton told a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
According to the report, the worst affected areas will be the Nile Delta in Egypt, Venice in Italy and Thessaloniki in Greece as a consequence of the expected rise in sea level.
As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, suggesting a broader climate change.
The extreme weather events may be more frequent and severe as the climate is getting warmer and wetter.
Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine ecosystem.
If warming temperatures were such a powerful bridge to disease, Dowlatabadi asks, why did malaria epidemics sweep through England and other chilly locales in previous generations?
