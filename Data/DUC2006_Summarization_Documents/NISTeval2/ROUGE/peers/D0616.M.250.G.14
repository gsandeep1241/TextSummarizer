Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Both the Russians and the Chechens have been fortifying fixed positions in recent days, but neither side has launched any major offensives.
With Russian warplanes hammering targets in Chechnya for an eighth day, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said an unspecified number of the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Russian troops in the area had moved into positions inside Chechnya.
Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of Chechnya's capital of Grozny, then pulled back to about three miles inside the border.
Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya.
The current campaign already shows similarities.
Despite reports of fire exchanges near the village of Bamut, about 70 kilometers southwest of Grozny, the Chechen capital, Russian authorities have kept tight-lipped about the clashes.
There were no casualties among the Russians.
Chechen rebels committed five terrorist blasts in several key cities of the war-torn republic Sunday night, killing at least 36 Russian servicemen and wounding 74, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced.
Russia vowed Thursday to pursue the mopping-up operation in the volatile republic of Chechnya to an end and destroy all Chechen rebels refusing to lay down their weapons.
