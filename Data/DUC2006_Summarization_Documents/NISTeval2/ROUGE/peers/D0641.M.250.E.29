The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in temperatures but by also favoring certain established weather patterns.
Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
The media likewise tend to take it as a given that the experts are in accord on global warming.
Agriculture also contributes 41 percent of the total EU nitrous oxide emissions, compared to 33 percent from industry and 20 percent from energy.
Changes in ocean temperature and circulation expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large ice sheet, as early as next century, he said.
Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.
Experts on all sides of the debate acknowledge that the climate models are imperfect, and even proponents of their use say their results should be interpreted cautiously.
What to do about global warming is controversial, both in Congress and in the international policy arena.
Politicians shouldn't be permitted to hijack science in their pursuit of power.
But Lindzen and Gray, pointing to what they consider the models' problems with the physics of the atmosphere, say they overestimate possible warming.
