Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois (PQ) leader and Quebec premier at the end of, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from PQ and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his resignation after the October 30 referendum on Quebec independence was defeated.
Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the independence movement in the province alive.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French speaking province of Quebec could declare independence if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
Chretien's statement came amid a row between Ottawa and the separatist government of Quebec over a court case challenging the legality of future referenda on Quebec's independence.
The poll found that 92% of Canadians living outside Quebec believe the province's Aboriginal people have the right to stay with Canada in the event of a vote for independence.
Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30 year fight for independence was a risky strategy for the federal government because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist government of Premier Lucien Bouchard more popular.
In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists gained 40% of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province where the referendum was held.
While the rest of Canada considers this a crucial election, the staunchest Quebec separatists concede that some passion has gone out of the secession movement.
