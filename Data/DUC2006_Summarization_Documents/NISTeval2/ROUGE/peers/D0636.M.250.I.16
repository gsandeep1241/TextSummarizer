There was no immediate indication what issues might have held up agreement on the contract for about 100,000 employees.
In conversations with reporters here, Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the UAW, and Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for labor relations, said they were pressing for a settlement before the automaker's two-week summer shutdown ended Monday but conceded talks were moving slowly.
``I hope in the future that the UAW and GM can sit down and find a different way of doing things, as we do with other automakers,'' said UAW president Stephen Yokich.
GM had sought the arbitration, alleging that the walkouts were illegal because they concerned national issues such as plant investments.
The UAW maintained the strikes were allowable under the contract because they concerned health and safety issues.
The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said.
The UAW conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt GM and the Chrysler Corp., which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler AG.
The talks at GM, while complicated and hard to resolve quickly, have been going well.
``They seem to want to work with us,'' much more so than in the past, said a UAW negotiator.
