PARIS _ Air France said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines because it believes a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July.
French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff.
Air France issued a one-paragraph statement on its lawsuit, saying it had been filed in the Pontoise commercial court, which covers the town of Gonesse, where the plane had dropped onto a small wooden hotel.
The statement said that under the civil aviation legal code, an airline is responsible for damage caused by any pieces that fall off its aircraft.
Continental issued a brief statement on Wednesday, saying that there was not proof that it was linked to the crash.
GONESSE, France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost power in two of its four engines as it was taking off, and the flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear, government investigators said Thursday.
The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or BEA, also said in a statement.
