Negotiations following such a referendum would undoubtedly be difficult.
Negotiators would have to contemplate the possibility of secession, there would be no absolute entitlement to it and no assumption that an agreement reconciling all relevant rights and obligations would actually be reached.
It is foreseeable that even negotiations carried out in conformity with the underlying constitutional principles could reach an impasse.
Questioning the legality of Quebec 's 30-year-fight for independence was a risky strategy for the federal government because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
Federal officials, shaken by the near victory of the separatists in the October 1995 referendum on separation, had decided it was far more risky to just sit back and do nothing.
The separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum.
In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists gained 40 percent of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province where the referendum was held.
In the October 1995 referendum, Quebec 's vote in favor of separation had increased to just over 49 percent.
Federal officials claim that separatists who have controlled the Quebec government for most of the last 20 years misled voters into thinking that separation would be quick and relatively easy.
