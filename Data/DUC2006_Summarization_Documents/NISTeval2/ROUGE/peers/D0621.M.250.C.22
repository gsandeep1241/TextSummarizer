China today put forward proposals for organized transnational crime and international exchange and cooperation to be included in the priorities of a U.N. anti-crime commission.
In a bid to strengthen judicial administration, China has over the last few years passed new laws on the police, prosecutors, judges, prisons and lawyers.
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times.
China has been striking hard against violent crime, focusing on wiping out those endangering social security and public order.
Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs which entered China from overseas.
China is backing the strengthening of international cooperation in fighting crime involving firearms, especially transnational firearms smuggling.
Last month, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery.
The South China Morning Post also quoted an unnamed prison source as saying Cheung and other defendants were fearful that some of Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them, so they were taking their meals from food that had been brought in for security officials.
The official Chinese news agency Xinhua has reported that all proceedings were appropriate under Chinese law, noting that many of the alleged crimes were plotted in China and some were carried out there.
