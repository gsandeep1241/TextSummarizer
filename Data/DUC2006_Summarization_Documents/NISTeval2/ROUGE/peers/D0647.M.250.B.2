In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return from Miami.
The boy's Miami relatives were given temporary custody of Elian, who immediately became the subject of an international tug-of-war.
But there have been television images of Elian laughing and swimming in a pool, Elian singing Cuba's national anthem, Elian writing his cursive letters on a blackboard and in a composition book, Elian dancing with maracas, Elian placing yellow gladiolas at a bronze statue of Marti.
The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
INTERNATIONAL CUBA-ELIAN Demonstrators sang and prayed outside the home where Elian Gonzales is staying as all sides in the custody battle waited for a federal appeals court ruling that could lead to the boy's reunion with his father.
INTERNATIONAL CUBA-ELIAN Pressure mounts on the relatives of Elian Gonzales to turn the boy over to his father as Attorney General Janet Reno reportedly has given approval to take the child by force, if necessary.
The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven- month long bitter custody battle.
