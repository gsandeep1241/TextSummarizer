Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one of the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestines during their final-status talks which has been launched on September 13.
Israel and the Palestinians have failed to hold substantive peace talks largely due to Israel's settlement activities since hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996.
The Palestinians hope to establish a future state in the West Bank and Gaza, and fear independence will be increasingly difficult to attain with the expansion of the Jewish settlements.
The Palestinians regard Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as illegal and demand that Israel evacuate all 144 settlements in these areas.
A senior Palestinian official Tuesday repeated objection to the continued expansion of Jewish settlements, saying it could prevent the beginning of the final status negotiations and destroy the peace process.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the new tenders.
The international community was surprised over Israel's construction work at the Abu Ghneim Mountain and Ras al-Amoud settlements and the expansion of the Maali Adumim settlement, al-Masri said.
Serious differences arose between Jordan and Israel over a planned expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank, Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher has said.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raised the settlement issue during talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in Washington last Friday.
