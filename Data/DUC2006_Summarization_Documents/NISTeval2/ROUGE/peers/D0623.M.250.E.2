On Thursday she notched her latest victory when the upper house of Parliament gave final approval to one of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws, which bans lighting up in public places and all tobacco advertising.
Lighting up in the Forbidden City, on a subway train, or other very public places can risk a small fine, perhaps 60 cents to dlrs 1.20 (5 to 10 yuan), but generally the 1996 ban on smoking in public places is ignored.
The new law has extended the non-smoking area to all places for health care, whether public or private, including clinics, chemist's shops and ambulance, places for people of under 16 years old, places producing or marketing inflammables, libraries, museums, public meeting halls, reading rooms, exhibition halls and within taxicabs.
Cigarette smoking in public has been outlawed in 71 major Chinese cities and three provinces, according the Chinese Association on Smoking & Health.
The bill lists various public places to enforce the smoking ban, including holy sites, mosques, factories, hospitals and clinics, transportation terminals, public transport, department stores, and hotels and restaurants.
BONN, February 5 (xinhua) The German parliament Thursday rejected a tough anti-smoking bill which tried to make public places, buses and working places free of smoking in Germany.
Since smoking in a public place causes serious secondary smoking and has a bad impact on youngsters, China has taken the ban on smoking in public places as a key part of the ban on smoking in public places in its anti-smoking effort.
