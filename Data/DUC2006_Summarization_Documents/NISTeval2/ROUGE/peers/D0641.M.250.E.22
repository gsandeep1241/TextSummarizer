Biologists say that the warming of the earth's surface over the last century has probably been caused by emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases.
McKelvey said the team's ultimate aim was to show the likely effect of future global warming.
Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said.
Study: satellite temperature readings on global warming were wrong.
The changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of global warming.
The study believed that because carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases contributing to the warming of the planet, the decrease of this greenhouse gas may therefore help slow the global warming.
The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
Yet the national response to global warming remains sluggish and divided, in part because of fears that tough pollution-control measures could hurt a vibrant economy.
This warming, the panel said, would touch off widespread disruptions in climate and weather and cause the global sea level to rise and flood many places.
