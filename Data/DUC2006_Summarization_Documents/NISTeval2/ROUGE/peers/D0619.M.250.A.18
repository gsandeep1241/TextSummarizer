The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992, when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed squarely at homosexuals.
``Homosexual activists are trying to use the Republican Party, much like the Democratic Party, as a vehicle to achieve their strategic objective of harnessing government and corporate power to impose acceptance of homosexual behavior,'' the groups told Bush, adding that gay groups ``seek nothing less than the ability to mandate teaching to schoolchildren that homosexuality is normal and healthy.'' Carl Schmid, an alternative GOP delegate to the GOP convention from Washington, D.C., who serves on the board of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy organization in the nation, said he was meeting with Bush in an effort to ``improve the understanding of gay people and gay issues within the Republican party.'' In contrast to GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who has thus far declined the group's invitation, McCain sat down with members of the Log Cabin Republicans last month and said that he would work to end discrimination, and that appears to be enough for many gay Republicans, particularly when the senator's position is compared with those of other presidential candidates.
``We don't allow pedophiles, transvestites and cross-dressers, either,'' he explained.
