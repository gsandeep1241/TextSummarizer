Experts say 90 percent of malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Since there is no vaccine against malaria, prevention depends on two important measures: taking a drug that combats the parasite prophylactically that is, in advance of any known infection and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito.
Malaria is a parasitic infection that is one of the world's worst scourges.
Malaria kills up to 3 million people a year and sickens another 300 million.
Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides.
It was also envisaged that by the year 2030, malaria would no longer be the major cause of deaths in Africa.
In a statement, the WHO said the initiative will be implemented in phases and was expected to reduce malaria illnesses and deaths in the region by 50 percent by the year 2010.
The experts said they were encouraged to come up with the strategy which channeled 10 million U.S. Dollars towards malaria control in Africa last year.
The animals' immune system produced antibodies that prevented malaria parasites from invading liver cells and from replicating in the blood, the scientists reported Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
In comparison, 92 out of another 297 people who took a placebo developed malaria.
