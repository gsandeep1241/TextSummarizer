The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision.
Ten Russian ships were in the area where the submarine went down.
Russia wants to begin efforts to recover the bodies of 118 men who died aboard the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk in September by cutting holes in the vessel's hull, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday.
While Klebanov wouldn't name the company that will help Russia do the work, he said it was not Norway's Stolt Offshore.
Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied that any American submarine collided with the Kursk, which plunged to the seabed on Aug. 12.
The summary, based on acoustic recordings and other information gathered by two U.S. submarines and a surface vessel in the Barents at the time, included evidence that U.S. officials have said contradicts assertions by some Russian officials that the Kursk sank after a collision with another submarine or a World War II-era mine.
