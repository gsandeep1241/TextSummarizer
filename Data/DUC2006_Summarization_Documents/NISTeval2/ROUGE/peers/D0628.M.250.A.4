After 14 months of treatment, 12 to 15 percent of kids on medication or combined therapy were diagnosed with ADHD, and 32 to 35 percent of children on psychosocial or community-based treatment still had the disorder.
The subjects for the research were part of a previous study of families with an ADHD child and families with no ADHD children.
The authors studied 56 ADHD patients who were on medication, 19 ADHD patients not on medication and 137 patients without the disorder.
" That's a very high rate of ADHD, by anyone's estimate," said psychologist Nadine M. Lambert of the University of California at Berkeley, a longtime ADHD researcher who was not involved in the current study.

He also is a member of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the most common treatment for ADHD, which affects up to 2.5 million school-age children in the In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, a team of researchers at six sites around the country, led by Jensen, followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their progress with various forms of treatment.
