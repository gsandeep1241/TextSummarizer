As a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the frequency and severity of drought could increase across the region.
"Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change," the study said.
Leading scientists came to the Science Summit to urge world leaders at their Kyoto Climate Summit in Japan in December to negotiate final agreement on a treaty to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are altering the climate.
The pace of climate change is predicted to be unprecedentedly quick due to the accumulation in atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth 's surface and a change in the global climate.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
The extreme weather events may be more frequent and severe as the climate is getting warmer and wetter.
Alusa noted that UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts of climate change on
