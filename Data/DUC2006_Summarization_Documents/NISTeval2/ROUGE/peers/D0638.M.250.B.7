Galileo survived the encounter, but not without some radiation hits causing erratic performance of spacecraft electronics.
This fluctuation can drive electrical currents in a conductor, like an ocean of salt water.
But a layer of ice at least 6 miles deep blocks the sun's life-sustaining energy from the water, according to a paper published in the journal Science.
The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for past life on Mars.
which are nearly invisible to even the best telescopes _ clearly show their relation to the moons' orbits, scientists said.
It completed its $ 1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway through a $ 30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and other moons.
NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
Joseph Burns, a space scientist at Cornell University, said the Jovian rings are formed from dusty debris knocked off moons by meteoroids.
The probe detected extremely strong winds and very intense turbulence during its descent through Jupiter's thick atmosphere.
Meanwhile, the space agency has agreed in principle to continue Galileo's operations past Jan. 31, when its current mission was to
