Rumors about the sailors trapped in a crippled Russian submarine on the sea floor circulate constantly in the offices, shops and homes of this Arctic port that glories in its ties to the navy.
There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy.
The Kursk belongs to the Northern Fleet, which is headquartered in the Murmansk region.
Russian and NATO officials held a four-hour meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss what kind of assistance the western alliance could offer to help save the 118 crew of a nuclear submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.
He said that after the Kursk shot a buoy to the surface to warn that it was in trouble, men on two Russian ships detected signs of a large underwater object ``equivalent in size'' to the Kursk.
British and Norwegian rescuers joined their Russian counterparts late Saturday in efforts to rescue the Kursk nuclear submarine that has been stranded at the bottom of the Barents Sea for a week.
The other submarine was the Memphis, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based in Groton, Conn., and one of two American submarines spying on the largest Russian naval exercise in years when disaster struck the Kursk on the morning of Aug. 12.
