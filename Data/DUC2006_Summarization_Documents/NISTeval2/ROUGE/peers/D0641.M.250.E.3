The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6 to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming the tropics but cooling the polar regions.
There is neither evidence that global warming is a serious problem and nor truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate, said an American scientist.
Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are by most atmospheric scientists to cause a change in the global climate.
While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting.' The theory is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, thereby increasing the warming even more.
But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's undue warming.
