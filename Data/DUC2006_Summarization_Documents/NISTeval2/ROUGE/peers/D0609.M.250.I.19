JERUSALEM ( AP ) Nearly 6,000 new houses and apartments are under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while close to 3,000 are standing empty, a peace group said Wednesday.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Palestinians hope to establish a future state in the West Bank and Gaza, and fear independence will be increasingly difficult to attain with the expansion of the Jewish settlements.
The Palestinian leader said that the Palestinians were stronger than the settlements and stronger than the settlers.
JERUSALEM ( AP ) In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel.
The Israeli government remains committed in the peace process with the Palestinians and respects the peace treaty signed with Jordan, the statement said.
Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
Jewish settlements is one of the outstanding obstacles that block the progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, that has been halted since Israeli construction of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in early 1997.
