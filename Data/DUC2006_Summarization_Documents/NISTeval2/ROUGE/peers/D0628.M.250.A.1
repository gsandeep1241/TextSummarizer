As a very young child, Alex Fenyn, now 7, exasperated his parents and teachers and intimidated peers with his hyperactive and aggressive behavior.
He was extremely cranky as an infant and had a bloodcurdling scream that made him sound like he was being tortured, says his mother, Tracy McNair, 42, a consultant from New York City.
His parents even gave him the nickname ``Mr.
Intensity''. In preschool and kindergarten, he was impulsive and unable to sit down.
Because Alex's classmates found his behavior so frightening, he was usually left to play by himself.
The turning point in Alex's life came at age 5, with a clinical diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a prescription for Ritalin, which his mother describes as a ``miracle drug''.
``The effect was immediate,'' she says.
``He had less trouble going from one activity to the next and would negotiate for a toy instead of grabbing it.
After three weeks, his classmates started to warm up to him, which is what I was hoping for.
I wanted him to gain some self-esteem''.
In what many see as a kind of vast, national experiment, millions of children in the United States are taking drugs prescribed by doctors to help manage mental and emotional health problems at ever-younger ages.
And the number of kids on medication is rising.
