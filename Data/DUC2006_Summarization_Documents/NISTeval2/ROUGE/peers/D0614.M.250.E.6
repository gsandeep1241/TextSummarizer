OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of January, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when "winning conditions" exist.
The Quebec issue has been dogging Canada in the past several decades.

Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the independence movement in the province alive.
Language, of course, divides the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec from most of the rest of Canada _ and the rest of North America, for that matter.
For Canada is getting tough on Quebec just as polls show the sovereignty movement going nowhere.
In a 1995 referendum on independence, the restive province of Quebec came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging Canada into its darkest political hour in decades.
While the rest of Canada considers this a crucial election, even the staunchest Quebec separatists concede that some passion has gone out of the secession movement.
Canada's federal government has asked the court to rule on three subjects: -- Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence under domestic law?
``The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government it has,'' Charest said.
