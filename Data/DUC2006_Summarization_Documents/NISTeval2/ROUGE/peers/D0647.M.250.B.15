In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana home.
Before midnight, Lazaro Gonzales, the great-uncle who has custody of the boy, emerged from his house in Miami and said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from the Miami family would go.
As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales.
Editorial-elian _ Janet Reno clarified Gonzales' legal situation by brushing aside Florida judge's interference.
April 12 -- Reno meets with Florida relatives and orders them to surrender Elian.
About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a meeting with the boy's father.
Gonzalez learned that Elian's father expected the Miami relatives to turn the boy over before their meeting, and the Miami family refused to do that.
Elian's Miami relatives have been unwilling to turn the boy over without assurances that he would not be quickly taken back to Cuba.
The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14.
`I am the father of Elian and Immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak for him,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said.
