Bush has said he supports the death penalty and doesn't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration.
But some suggest Bush, if concerned about the fairness of Texas' death penalty, could use his power of persuasion to generate public support for a moratorium.
Bush acknowledged the protests but said he had to uphold the laws of Texas.
''I recognize there are good people who oppose the death penalty,'' he said.
''I've heard their message and I respect their heartfelt point of view.'' Bush was peppered with questions from several Canadian journalists, who had traveled to Texas to cover Faulder's case.
But he refused to be drawn into a debate over the death penalty.
On Monday, aboard the campaign plane that brought him out to the West Coast to begin a week of campaigning that he knew would be dominated by the latest scheduled execution in Texas, Bush was more voluble on the death penalty than usual.
``Gary is the only client I have had in Texas who we thought is innocent, and I still believe he is,'' said Graham's attorney, Richard Burr, a veteran capital defense lawyer and death penalty foe.
At the time that Texas executed pick ax murderer Karla Faye Tucker in 1998, Bush wrote, he was challenged at the dinner table by one of his teenage daughters, who declared her opposition to the death penalty.
They want to embarrass Bush and halt capital punishment by exposing flaws in the Texas system.
