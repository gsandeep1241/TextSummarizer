"Our first priority is to advance Quebec...
to push it farther toward its destiny," he said.
Charest rhetorically asked audiences the question that seems to mystify everyone except Quebecers: Why should this bountiful province seek to quit one of the world's most prosperous, successful democracies?
But he seems to have gone from hero to goat, with the latest polls showing the Liberals headed for a stinging defeat.
During the campaign, Bouchard attacked Charest relentlessly and raised doubts about how well he really knew Quebec, since Charest had been away from the province for so long, Morton said.
Those cuts have angered many, presenting the Liberals with ample targets.
The modern separatist movement began about 30 years ago and is based on deeply rooted feelings that Quebec has not been treated fairly by English speaking Canada.
However, the results indicate that Quebec voters drew a sharp distinction between Bouchard's ability to govern and his party's commitment to holding a third referendum on separation.
That means Premier Lucien Bouchard will not call another wrenching referendum on breaking away from Canada any time soon, though he has not ruled out doing so later.
Nor was Bouchard able to maintain the percentage of the overall vote his party had in the last elections in 1994.
In the final results of Monday's election, his separatist Parti Quebecois won 75 seats, two fewer than in 1994, while the Liberal Party, which favors keeping Quebec in Canada, won 48, an increase of one .
