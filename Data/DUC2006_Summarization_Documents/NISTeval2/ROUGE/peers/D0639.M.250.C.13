Facing questions about the U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, the Clinton administration sought to justify the strike by offering more details linking the factory to the production of chemical weapons.
The officials declined to name the chemical, which the administration has classified, but they said it had no other known use that would explain its presence in the plant, called the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co.
The United States struck the plant in Sudan and a paramilitary training camp in Afghanistan with a simultaneous barrage of roughly 75 cruise missiles.
The chemical that the United States cited to justify its bombing of a Sudanese factory could be used for commercial products, the agency overseeing the treaty barring chemical weapons said.
The United States has insisted that the chemical found outside the plant could only mean that the plant was intended to make the nerve agent VX.
Washington only increases skepticism about its claim that the Shifa chemical factory in Sudan was really producing nerve gas ingredients and thus had to be destroyed to prevent new terrorist attacks.
The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary because U.S. intelligence showed the El Shifa plant produced chemical weapons.
The diplomats and the former government official said it was not absolutely clear at which of several plants the Iraqis were working on chemical weapons or their precursors.
U.S. officials continue to say they bombed a facility that produced a key ingredient for a deadly nerve agent.
