Rising ocean temperatures are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said on June 8th, 1999, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
The B.C. suit alleges that intensive Alaskan interception of Canadian-bound fish violated the basic principles of conservation and share in the Pacific Salmon Treaty.
The U.S. refusal to honor the Pacific Salmon Treaty is costing Canadian fishermen at least 60 million dollars a year.
The talks to end the four-year deadlock in the Pacific Salmon Treaty involve reducing the high levels of U.S. interception of salmon heading through Alaskan waters in Canadian waters to breed, and a balanced reduction in Canadian and American interception each other's salmon stocks farther south off Vancouver Island, in the Fraser River and Straits of Juan de Fuca.
The United States and Canada signed an agreement aimed at protecting and building up dwindling Pacific salmon supplies.
The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch.
That includes 91 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Columbia-Snake river system; 60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada; and 39 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service's salmon recovery efforts.
