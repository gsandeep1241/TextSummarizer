Seven months after he was cast adrift in the Florida straits, Elian Gonzalez returned to his native Cuba Wednesday evening, bringing to a close an international custody battle laced with Cold War passions.
The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven-month long bitter custody battle.
The battle over Elian is not between two governments but between two ideological camps on differing sides of the Florida Straits: in Miami and Havana.
About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a meeting with the boy's father.
As both sides in the Elian Gonzales custody case await a federal appeals court ruling, the mayor of Miami flies to Washington to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that Elian belongs to his father in Cuba, but Elian's Miami relatives insist the boy stay with them in the United States.
The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here.
The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
The custody flap over 6-year-old Elian Gonzales could ultimately strengthen U.S.-Cuba relations if American officials stand firm
