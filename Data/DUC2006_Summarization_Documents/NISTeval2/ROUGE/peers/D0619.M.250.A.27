The platform of the Texas Republican Party states that homosexuality ``is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God'' and opposes gay marriage and the repeal of sodomy laws.
Representatives of the Traditional Values Coalition and the Family Research Council, both conservative bastions of opposition to gay rights, met Tuesday with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the GOP committee that gathers in Philadelphia later this week to hash out they party's platform.
The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992, when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed squarely at homosexuals.
Sharpening the irony of the debate, the Log Cabin Republicans have invited two conservative icons to address their convention: University of California Regent Ward Connerly and Washington political pundit Arianna Huffington.
The gay Republicans are also heartened that the GOP presidential campaign seems to be welcoming Mary Cheney, 31, the openly lesbian daughter of vice-presidential pick Dick Cheney.
A spokesman for Texas Gov. George Bush, who is expected to win the presidential nomination at the convention, replied that Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe's sexual orientation has nothing to do with his scheduled speech on free trade.
