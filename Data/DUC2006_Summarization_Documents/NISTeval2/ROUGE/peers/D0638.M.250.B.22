The probe found that lighting occurs on Jupiter only about one-tenth as often as on Earth, which is consistent with the absence of water clouds but reduces the possibility of finding organic molecules in the Jovian atmosphere.
In addition to the gravitational studies, Galileo has measured magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter and its moons.
Io has been glowing for a billion years.
_____ BONUS: It is likely that soon you will be able to travel to Jupiter in order to get a closer look at its glimmering moon.
___ MOON MATCH-UP: Jupiter and Earth aren't the only planets that have satellites.
Use an encyclopedia to help you match each moon with its mother planet.
The incident occurred about four hours after a flyby within 900 miles of the surface of Europa and one hour after passing within 360,000 miles of Jupiter's atmosphere.
Organisms could live in the oceans heated by the strain of Jupiter's gravitational pull, researchers had said.
Otherwise the planetesimals would not have been cold enough to trap the volatile gases, which would have been dispersed among the other tenuous matter in interplanetary space.
Galileo, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995, is not scheduled to make any more encounters of Europa.
In the same tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft has defied engineering's actuarial tables to complete more than four years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four major moons, each one a spectacle to the eye and a surprise to the scientific mind.
