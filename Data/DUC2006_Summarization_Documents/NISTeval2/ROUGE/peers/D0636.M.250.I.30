General Motors Corp. has signaled to Wall Street that it expects the United Auto Workers to make a stronger push for wage increases in this year 's contract talks with Detroit 's automakers.
That would mark a shift from previous negotiations in the 1990s, when the union sought relatively benign wage hikes in exchange for job security.
It means automakers may have to give workers more of their growing revenues to ensure labor peace, a change that has some on Wall Street fearing a possible inflationary effect on the U.S. economy.
The UAW did not return phone calls for comment.
The strategy expected by GM is in line with the collective bargaining resolution the union approved last May, arguing that its members deserve a larger share of the profits that GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG are making on U.S. sales.
The automakers are on track to set an annual record for earnings in 1999.
The current three-year contracts expire Sept. 14.
At a recent meeting with about 40 major investors and analysts, GM chairman Jack Smith said the UAW felt it missed out on this decade 's real wage growth and would likely place a higher priority on wage increases this year, according to investor sources who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.
GM declined to comment.
