Huge tracts of Earth's surface could disappear under rising oceans, creating millions of" environmental refugees," British climate scientist John Houghton told a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The cloud _ a harbinger of climate change, some call it _ appears as global warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields ranging from atmospheric physics to biology.
He said that a 50 cm rise in the sea level will increase the number of people under the threat of flooding from the current 46 million to 92 million annually.
An international climate conference scheduled for next in Kyoto, Japan, will focus on greenhouse gas emissions.
There are 160 signatories to the U.N.
Climate Convention, an agreement designed to stabilize greenhouse gases at levels that would avoid catastrophic climate change.
The most obvious possible cause, they said, is global warming produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide, which result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.
Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said.
But there is no firm evidence that man-made global warming is even occurring.
For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
