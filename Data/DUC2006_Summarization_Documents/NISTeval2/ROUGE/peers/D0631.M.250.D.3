French investigators have they a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane as the Concorde, and set off the events within minutes after takeoff.
French investigators met Thursday to try to determine what new safety measures are required before Air France can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
PARIS Air France said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines because it believes a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July.
Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes after the July 25 crash of Concorde Flight AF, which plunged to the ground about 90 seconds after take-off, killing 113 people in the first fatal accident involving the supersonic airplane.
But, while Air France suspended its Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash, British Airways ordered only a one-day suspension before putting its own Concordes back into service.
Air France says two-thirds of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business, while the rest are celebrities, the superrich or vacationers like members of the German tour group who died in Tuesday's crash.
After the crash, Air France agreed to temporarily ground its five remaining Concordes, and British Airways grounded its two remaining flights for Tuesday night.
His trip was delayed after Air France suspended all its Concorde flights until the airline is convinced the planes are safe.
