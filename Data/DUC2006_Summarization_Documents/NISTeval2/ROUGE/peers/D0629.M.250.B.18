Melissa is a new and spectacularly promiscuous computer virus, one that has infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide since its discovery less than a week ago.
Melissa, as the new viral vixen was named by its creator _ as yet unknown _ combines elements of both a computer virus (spreading from file to file) and a worm program (spreading from computer to computer over a network).
It is only one of several recent viruses designed to prey on an otherwise useful feature of Microsoft Word that enables macro programs _ automated scripts that trigger one or more actions in the host computer _ to be started from within a file.
The typical hoax letter says that there is a new and particularly nasty virus on the loose, confirmed by (insert the name of some completely irrelevant organization like the Federal Communications Commission), and that if you open an e-mail message with a certain subject line, a virus will delete all the files on your hard drive.
In almost all cases, the hoax letter will urge the recipient to pass this important message along to as many people as possible.
The virus arrives in a person's e-mail box as a timely reply from an acquaintance.
Zamora quoted reports as saying the computer virus, which was allegedly created by a Philippine couple using Internet access cards, has caused up to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in damage to computer systems in more than 20 countries in Asia, America and Europe.
