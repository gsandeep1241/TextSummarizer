ULAN BATOR, April 4 (Xinhua) - Canadian Senate speaker Gildas Molgat has announced that his country will give financial aid to Mongolia and set up an honorary consulate here to promote economic and trade relations between the two countries.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the U.S. government attached great importance to the strategic status of Mongolia, which led to rapid development of the relations between the two countries.
She said that the United States was satisfied with the development of relations and cooperation with Mongolia during the past ten years after the two countries set up diplomatic ties.
"We believe that developing relations with China and Russia has been and will always be the primary principle of Mongolia's foreign policies," he said.
Herzog said that Germany, which supports Mongolia in developing market economy, will promote relations with this Asian country.
Primakov said that in spite of these problems, Russia's relations with Mongolia are developing positively and that there are no major conflicts between the two countries.
Mongolia's reforms, aimed at transforming its centrally-planned economy into a market-oriented one, have won support from France and Britain since they were launched in 1990, said Ochirbat, shortly after his return from his first visit to the two countries.
