El Nino is a periodic warming of the water in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which shifts weather patterns arriving from that area and can affect the climate worldwide.
Richard Feely and colleagues form the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have found that during the El Nino years between 1991 and 1994, the release of carbon dioxide from equatorial Pacific Ocean was between 30 and 80 percent of that in 1996, a non-El Nino year.
Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday.
La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
La Nina's impacts include heavy rains, severe storms and flooding in southern Africa, drought in Kenya and Tanzania, flooding in the Philippines and Indonesia and abnormal wetness in northern South America.
Israeli scientists have achieved progress in predicting the chaotic behavior of El Nino, a warming of surface water of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, through a sophisticated computer simulation.
Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina -- a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino's -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
