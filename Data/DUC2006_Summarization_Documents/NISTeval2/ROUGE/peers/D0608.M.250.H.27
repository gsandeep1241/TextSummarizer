The new system, unveiled at the Detroit auto show Wednesday, includes an airbag-like curtain on each side of the vehicle and is a response to the federal government's revelation that almost half the people who die in light trucks and SUVs die in rollover accidents.
While some auto makers, including Mercedes, Volvo and BMW have air bag curtains that inflate across the car windows and could potentially help during a rollover, experts believe Ford's is the first that is designed specifically for rollover protection.
Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents.
Government studies have shown that eight of 10 safety seats are installed incorrectly.
When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships.
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses to get involved.
So far, only DaimlerChrysler has come forward but other automakers are considering the proposal.
General Motors Corp. also is considering some type of permanent fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said.
