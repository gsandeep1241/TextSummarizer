In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in temperatures but by also favoring certain established weather patterns.
The abstract concludes that there is no basis for believing (1) that atmospheric CO2 is causing a dangerous climb in global temperatures, (2) that greater concentrations of CO2 would be harmful, or (3) that human activity leads to global warming in the first place.
The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects of global warming on El Nino's frequency.
For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
Kelly said that while the Global Climate Coalition questions whether global warming is happening, it advocates that companies voluntarily explore and employ new technology to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming.
The study believed that because carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases contributing to the warming of the planet, the decrease of this greenhouse gas may therefore help slow the global warming.
