Wetlands are thus ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild plants and waterfowl.
The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development.
Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth 's "kidney" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land.
Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system.
Since last summer, the corps has been updating its nationwide system for issuing permits to fill wetlands, seeking to identify areas where wetlands are particularly vulnerable or important and need protection.
The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms.
The EPA has no say in the final decision on wetlands rules by the corps, but has indicated that the wetlands around the reservoirs deserve special protection.
Americans destroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that these swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing floodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap water.
New regulations that will make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically sensitive areas.
