A recent Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition found evidences that the ice sheet was considerably smaller during the last major period of global warming 38 million years ago.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., agreed it will take more study to understand how global warming might affect El Nino.
The effect of global warming in Texas and the projected corresponding 1-to2-foot rise in the sea level could add additional stress on already tight water supplies.
South African Environment Minister Valli Moosa said that global warming resulted in the rise in incidence of malaria.
Scientists who argue against global warming often cite nearly 20 years of satellite readings showing slight cooling of the atmosphere two miles up.
One U.S. atmospheric scientist, John R. Christy at the University of Alabama, contends satellite and balloon data show significant global warming is not occuring now.
Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns.
The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in temperatures but by also favoring certain established weather patterns.
There is neither evidence that global warming is a serious problem and nor truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt
