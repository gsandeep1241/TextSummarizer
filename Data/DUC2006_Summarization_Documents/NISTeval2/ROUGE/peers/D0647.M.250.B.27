Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day.
The development came as negotiations between federal immigration officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse.
U.S. officials postponed a deadline for revoking the boy's custody status.
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials ended a tense five-hour meeting Wednesday night with Elain's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, who has cared for the boy since he was rescued at sea in November.
The Miami family then filed a federal court suit to challenge the federal decision and to request an asylum hearing for the boy, but last week a Miami federal judge ruled against them.
The family then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which on Monday set oral arguments for May 8.
Underlying the complicated standoff is the fact that since he was rescued at sea, Elian has been legally in the custody of Reno.
Attorney General Janet Reno earlier Thursday urged those involved in the dispute over the Cuban boy to resolve the situation quickly so the child can get on with his life.
The meeting centered on an INS demand that Gonzalez pledge to turn the boy over for a return to Cuba if the family loses its court fight to keep Elian in the United States.
Under federal law, the attorney general has the authority to ignore the pending court appeal and send Elian home to Cuba immediately.
