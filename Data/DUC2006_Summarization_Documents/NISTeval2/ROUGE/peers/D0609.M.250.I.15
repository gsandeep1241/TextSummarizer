About 17,000 Palestinians from West Bank and Gaza as well as thousands of Israeli Arabs work in the settlements.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Palestinians have been angered by the Israeli cabinet's approval of the construction of 2,600 new housing units in four West Bank settlements this week.
The Palestinians maintain that construction of Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip violates the convention.
The Peace Now survey showed that at least 2,880 housing units in the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip are vacant.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza reached 200, with settlers to be 170,000 by the end of the year 2000.
Successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout the West Bank.
Israeli police removed Jewish settlers occupying a remote hilltop west of the Kedumin settlement in northern West Bank.
Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank.
Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5,892 units under construction.
The Palestinians charge that expansion of the settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace settlement.
