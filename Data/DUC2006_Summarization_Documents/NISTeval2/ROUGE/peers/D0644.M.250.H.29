WASHINGTON -- President Clinton is forecasting decades of federal budget surpluses, $4.854 trillion worth by 2014 -- precise predictions that come with only one certainty.
And all I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a while until we have a better grip on what the true balance in the federal government accounts is.
The administration's budget plan shows that Clinton would not use any of the Social Security surplus for other programs.
Individual retirement accounts, or IRA's, allow people to save money for retirement while receiving special tax treatment.
Part of the reason for the anticipated huge budget surpluses _ $5.9 trillion over the next 15 years by one administration measure _ is the failure of congressional and White House analysts to predict the feverish growth of the economy when compiling the federal budgets over the last six years.
Achieving that alignment seems more pressing than it did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depths of our various buffers against inflationary pressures.
The banks have less money available to make loans and interest rates increase.
To the degree that the surplus goes to spending _ or tax cuts _ those interest savings would not be realized.
Indeed, despite the bipartisan commitments to improving the government's financial condition, some conservatives are uncomfortable with too much emphasis on debt reduction, saying it should not become a fixation that outweighs tax cuts as a priority for Republicans.
