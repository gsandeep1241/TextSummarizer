Barnes & Noble, the world's largest bookstore chain, called off its $600 million purchase of the world's biggest book distributor because of opposition from antitrust regulators.
The announcement this month that the nation's leading bookseller, Barnes & Noble, will buy the leading wholesaler, the Ingram Book Group, for $600 million is just the latest move in a shifting field of distribution networks.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions.
Using consumer diaries of book purchases, an earlier industry study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books in the same period.
A study reported that books sold online tripled their market share from 1.9 percent to 5.4 percent.
The resolution is actually far lighter than the original proposed by independent seller Andy Ross, owner of Cody's Books Inc. in Berkeley.
So as the country's independent booksellers and publishers gathered for their annual prom _ called BookExpo America _ there was reason for hope about upcoming books and the selling seasons ahead.
Those booksellers are banding together to create a common electronic bookstore of their own, Book Sense, which has signed up more than 860 members.
The decision, a significant victory for both publishers and independent booksellers, which have waged a powerful campaign against the proposed deal since it was announced does not bode well for the planned acquisition.
