Straw, setting out the government's point-by-point response to the Lawrence report, said his plan of action should bring about "real, practical change." A public inquiry after the Lawrence case found London police institutionally racist, prompting a government pledge to take a more active role in combating racial intolerance.
Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson -- were formally acquited of the murder of Stephen three years ago when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrences collapsed.
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week.
The report into the racist murder of Lawrence which was released earlier in the day labeled London's police force "institutionally racist" and condemned officers for "fundamental errors." Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw unveiled new curbs Wednesday to combat police racism in the country after a damning report on ther murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
After the Macpherson report, the government promised to broaden anti-discrimination laws and make immediate changes in policing methods.
The parents of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence began legal action on Wednesday against the men suspected of his killing.
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted "institutional racism" in London's Metropolitan Police following the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
