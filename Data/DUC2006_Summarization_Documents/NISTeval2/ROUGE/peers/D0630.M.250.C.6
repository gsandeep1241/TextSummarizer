Abe Zimmerman took along experienced guides: the Austin store's buying director Tracey Tarlton and marketing manager David Hutts, a veteran of the Book Expos that serve as the American Bookseller Association's annual conventions.
Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according to the American Booksellers Association.
Things have gotten so grim for independents that they come to the annual confab of the American Booksellers Association wondering about the latest book stores killed in action and, as bookseller John Barrigner of Charlotte, N.C., put it, ``which of our good friends we won't see in 1999''.
The most recent statistics from the Association of American Publishers indicate that the books clubs have been holding their own, but executives complain they have not been growing as fast as online booksellers.
NEW YORK _ Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
The booksellers association is also creating its own on-line selling site, BookSense.com, scheduled to be ready by late summer.
BOOKSELLERS COZY UP TO THE WEB.
Increasingly, the booksellers association is involved in litigation as independents fight back any way they can against changes they see as threatening their survival in the industry.
Booksellers have long seen themselves as involved in a marketplace of ideas and, as such, different from the owners of hardware and drugstores.
This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the programs.
