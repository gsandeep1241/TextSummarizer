VX, the chemical nerve agent that the administration alleges Sudan was preparing to make, is one of the deadliest nerve agents known to man, especially when applied to the skin.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference Thursday that the administration had bombed the Shifa Chemical Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan because the intelligence community was ``confident'' that the plant was ``involved in the production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor chemicals for deadly V-series of nerve agents, like, for example, VX''.
A senior administration official said that Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier, has been working with the Islamic militant government in Sudan since 1995 to develop and buy dual use equipment that can be used to produce VX and other weapons of mass destruction.
Serbia is known to have inherited from the former Yugoslavia a sophisticated and extensive chemical weapons program, which involved three production plants on Serbian territory and one that was moved from Mostar in Bosnia to Lucani in southern Serbia by Yugoslav forces in 1992, according to Jonathan B. Tucker, a chemical weapons expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies.
Although the administration says the precursor has no other use than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical weapons, said another administration official, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
In that attack, the deadly compound was sprayed directly on the victim's skin.
