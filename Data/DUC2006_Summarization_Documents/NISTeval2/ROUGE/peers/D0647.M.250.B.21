WASHINGTON _ The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana home.
The boy's Miami relatives were given temporary custody of Elian, who immediately became the subject of an international tug-of-war.
In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return from Miami.
The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven- month long bitter custody battle.
As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, asking for temporary custody of the boy.
The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
Elian's custody battle began after he survived a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 other illegal Cuban migrants on November 22, 1999.
U.S. Urged to return Cuban Boy Immediately.
