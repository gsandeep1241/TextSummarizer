The Russian governmental commission on the accident of the submarine Kursk sinking in the Barents Sea on August 12 has rejected 11 original explanations for the disaster, but still cannot conclude what caused the tragedy indeed, Russian Deputy Premier Ilya Klebanov said here Friday.
Klebanov rejected reports the Kursk was testing of torpedo.
Russia has asked Western countries to examine their submarines that were in the Barents Sea in August when the Kursk submarine sank, but received no answer, Klebanov told the deputies.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
The other submarine the Memphis, one of two American submarines spying on the largest Russian naval exercise in years when disaster struck the Kursk on the morning of Aug. 12.
By the time the Memphis reached Bergen, Norway, officials in Russia had said that the Kursk probably had sunk after colliding with either a foreign submarine or a World War II mine.
WASHINGTON Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's Navy sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Thursday night collision with a heavy object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
