Parents and people are the target group of the conference, which is organized around five areas : communications ; education ; family and community ; medicine and research ; and options for adulthood and independence. Inspired by new findings on the way animal brains develop before and after birth, scientists are developing provocative new theories to explain autism, a mysterious brain abnormality that prevents human infants from developing normal social and cognitive skills.
A: Current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain, but no specific cause.
A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society of America, "2000 National Conference on Autism: Celebrating Our Future," is focusing on treatment options, research and the incidence of autism.
It is not caused by bad parenting, and children with autism are not kids who choose to misbehave.
"Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right around the time of diagnosis," she says.
Many children with autism, for example, have digestive problems, including food allergies, a phenomenon that has given rise to the "rogue peptide" theory.
But the rise is fueling an unprecedented concern over the best way to help children with autism, as well as intensified research into possible causes and cures.
The situation has gotten so acute that a group of 30 local families has banded together to lobby for improved services and persuaded Children's Hospital to begin a program specializing in pediatric autism .
