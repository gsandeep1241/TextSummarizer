As relatives paid tribute in Paris to the 113 people killed when their burning Air France Concorde jet plunged to earth Tuesday, experts converged on the crash site in this town of factories and pastures to begin the painstaking task of putting names to bodies.
Investigators removed two engines from the Concorde crash site Wednesday in hopes the wreckage of the Air France supersonic jet will help determine the cause of the disaster that killed 113 people.
British aviation authorities on Wednesday formally ruled the Concorde supersonic airliner unfit to fly unless its manufacturers took steps to prevent the problems that led to last month's fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris.
A metal strip that investigators believe may have led to the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde last July apparently came from a Continental Airlines DC10 that had taken off from the same runway only minutes before the Concorde, the French agency investigating the disaster said on Monday.
Air France said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines because it believes a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July.
French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff.
