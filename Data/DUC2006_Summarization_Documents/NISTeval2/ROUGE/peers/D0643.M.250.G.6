Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina -- a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino's -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
Climate experts said this year's El Nino was one of the century's largest and most disruptive weather phenomena.
La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west.
``El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time,'' said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate Prediction Center.
Although the current La Nina conditions are following on the heels of last winter's El Nino, they often occur years apart and don't alternate in an orderly progression.
La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
La Nina Seems To Be Vanishing.
SAN FRANCISCO _ La Nina, the assertive sister of last year's hellacious El Nino, has already contributed to freakish weather around the globe and will continue to bring colder than normal temperatures to the West Coast well into spring, according to government forecasters.
This summer has been unusual, with a growing La Nina sharing the ocean with remnants of the strongest El Nino on record.
