Specifically, the task force report charges that Iraq in 1995 helped Sudan build a chemical weapons plant in Wau, in south-western Sudan, as well as a gas storage site. y E. Smithson of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an arms research organization in Washington, said it would not take a large amount of precursor chemicals _ or space _ to make a weapon . Although the United States struck at the Shifa plant, officials in Washington acknowledged that the second plant is also suspected of making chemical weapons . The international treaty group, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, conceded that it was not aware of any commercial product on the market that contained the chemical, nor of another chemical compound made with it . Serbia is known to have inherited from the former Yugoslavia a sophisticated and extensive chemical weapons program, which involved three production plants on Serbian territory and one that was moved from Mostar in Bosnia to Lucani in southern Serbia by Yugoslav forces in 1992, according to Jonathan B. Tucker, a chemical weapons expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies . He said evidence suggests that bin Laden was seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, for use against American targets .
