`` The quality of the Galileo probe data exceeds all of our most optimistic predictions, '' said Dr. Wesler Huntress, Associate Administrator for Space Science with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ). A report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the planet with extraterrestrial life . The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled . `` Comparisons between this ...
fault ( on Europa ) and faults on Earth may generate ideas we can use in studying earth movements here on our planet, '' University of Arizona space scientist Randy Tufts said Monday at the American Geophysical Union conference here . Jupiter ' s moon Europa probably could not support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely support single-cell organisms, let alone complex species such as those found on Earth, researchers said Thursday .
