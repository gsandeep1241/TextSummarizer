, said there are a host of options for saving the program if all of the federal budget surplus is put toward bolstering Social Security.
The White House said it is banking on the booming economy to produce budget surpluses over the next 15 years of $ 4.4 trillion.
With both parties agreeing to devote most of the surplus to Social Security, their major difference is whether the remainder should go to tax cuts, as Republicans want, or to fixing financial problems in the Medicare health insurance program, a top Clinton priority.
Although he initially proposed spending some of it over the next decade, Clinton is now more firmly committed to using the entire Social Security surplus for debt reduction.
At that rate, the CBO could be $ 250 billion off in 2004, which exceeds the $ 234 billion surplus it forecasts for that budget year.
My preference is that the surpluses be returned as tax cuts so the government share of the economy will shrink and the private share of the economy will expand, said Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan administration economist who is now with American Skandia, an investment firm.
We believe our fundamental economic policy is sound, Clinton said, with employment levels at records levels and the U.S. government about to record its first budget surplus in nearly three decades.
But now that the budget has been balanced, Democrats and many Republicans would like to see some federal spending increased.
Deficits that had presumably been the horror
