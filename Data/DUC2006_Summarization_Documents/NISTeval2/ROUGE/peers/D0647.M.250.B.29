In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza night to demand his return from Miami.
The Supreme Court refused to issue an order to keep Elian Gonzalez in the United States, clearing the way for the 6-year-old boy to return home to Cuba.
We've talked before about the kinds of problems this presents.
The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that the child be returned to him in Cuba.
As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, asking for temporary custody of the boy.
If the court grants the petition, Gonzales plans to request a federal asylum hearing.
About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami relatives would travel to Washingt with Elian for a meeting with the boy's father.
Elian was found clinging to a rubber tube last Nov. 25 after the boat he, his mother, and several others used in their attempt to come to the United States capsized.
Moreover, individual Cuban-Americans said they were willing to form human blockades and even lay down their lives if necessary to keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States.
