While psychiatrists said that there are cases of overmedication and undermedication, part of the problem is that psychiatric disorders are diagnosed clinically, which means that decisions are based on the history of clinical signs and symptoms.
Using a radioactive ``label,'' scientists have demonstrated abnormally high concentrations of a key brain protein in seven adults who had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.
About 5 percent of the children met all the criteria of ADHD, and 12 percent of those ADHD-diagnosed children had been treated with stimulant drugs in the past year.
Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the most common treatment for ADHD, which affects up to 2.5 million school-age children in the United States .

After 14 months of treatment, 12 to 15 percent of kids on medication or combined therapy were diagnosed with ADHD, and 32 to 35 percent of children on psychosocial or community-based treatment still had the disorder.
Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving.
ADHD is currently diagnosed according to a set of guidelines written by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
