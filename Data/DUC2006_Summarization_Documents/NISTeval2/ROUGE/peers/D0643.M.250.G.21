La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.

South African weather experts has said that the El Nino weather phenomenon is shaping to hit South Africa stronger than ever before.
