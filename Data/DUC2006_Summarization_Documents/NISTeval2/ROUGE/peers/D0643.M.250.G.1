For many parts of the Americas and Asia, the occasional warming and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in, usually with little warning, then staying for months or sometimes a year or two, bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of storms and droughts, heat and cold.
Now, after a record El Nino in 1997 and 1998, followed almost immediately by a prolonged La Nina, the tropical Pacific has shaken off its fever and chills and is expected for at least a year to be ``normal''.
So one might think meteorologists could relax a bit.
But it is exactly the opposite, many of them say.
Now they are sweating.
With no El Nino or La Nina, there is no sheep dog driving the sheep, no strong organizing force giving shape to the otherwise chaotic flow of weather across the seas and continents.
As a result, long-term forecasts _ the ones that help determine the price of oil or natural gas futures, the ones that determine how much road salt your town buys this fall _ are looking a bit like guesswork.
``Over the last three years, a lot of people have looked pretty sharp,'' said Dr. William C. Patzert, a research oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
``Now the going gets tough''.
