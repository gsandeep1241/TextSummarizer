AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Two Moroccan female athletes have been stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an official said Friday.
Both athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, a muscle-building steroid that has been the cause of a rash of recent positive tests -- including several at the Pan American Games and even others announced this week in advance of the World Championships.
But they can use diuretics that will get the steroids out of their system quickly, and they can use some new steroids that are water-based, that clear the body a lot faster that the oil-based ones''.
The cost to the three tennis organizations is approximately $500,000 per year, and so far, the only other player found guilty of using steroids is the 23-year-old Truyol, who said he took them on the advice of his physician when recovering from an injury.
_ In his book, ``The Steroids Game,'' Penn State professor Charles Yesalis estimates the use of steroids among female college athletes at 5 percent in swimming, 6 percent in basketball and 10 percent in track and field.

``If this (the reversal of the samples and the subsequent testing of them in the wrong order, according to international rules) is fact, it would be very hard to prosecute this case,'' said Dr. Gary
