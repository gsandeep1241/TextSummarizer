Wang and his colleagues found the links between sunspot activity and El Nino through satellite photos, and say that sunspot activity can affect ocean temperatures and cloud, which give rise to El Nino.
Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino 's would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
Bangladesh 's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization ( SPARRSO ) is monitoring the El Nino phenomenon, which is responsible for rains or drought world-wide, to help the country 's farmers cope with its effects, SPARRSO director Dr AM Chowdhury told a recent function at the Bangladesh Institute of Strategic Studies.
Effects include heavy rainfall in northern Peru and southern Ecuador, and unusually warm, dry conditions as far away as the northeastern United States and western tropical Pacific.
Those conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
The pool of unusually cool tropical water marked by low sea levels has shriveled and the equatorial Pacific is warming to normal temperatures, NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said this week.
He said that he and his competitors have to look at subtler influences on weather, including things like sunspot cycles or soil condition in the Midwest or other less obvious temperature shifts in the Pacific and Atlantic.
Although the current La Nina conditions are following on the heels of last winter 's El Nino, they often occur years apart and don't alternate in an orderly
