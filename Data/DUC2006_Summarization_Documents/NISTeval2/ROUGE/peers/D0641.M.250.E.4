The theory is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, thereby increasing the warming even more.
Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said.
In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
The study believed that because carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases contributing to the warming of the planet, the decrease of this greenhouse gas may therefore help slow the global warming.
" Global warming won't be a simple warming of the Earth.
The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6 to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming the tropics but cooling the polar regions.
The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects of global warming on El Nino's frequency.
Kelly said that while the Global Climate Coalition questions whether global warming is happening, it advocates that companies voluntarily explore and employ new technology to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming.
