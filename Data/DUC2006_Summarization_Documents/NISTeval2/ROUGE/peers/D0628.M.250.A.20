Critics say doctors are too quick to diagnose Adhd and over-prescribe drugs for children.
Jensen said the problem is that thousands of children aren't treated and more than one-half of children with the disorder have not been diagnosed.
After 14 months of treatment, 12 to 15 percent of kids on medication or combined therapy were diagnosed with Adhd, and 32 to 35 percent of children on psychosocial or community-based treatment still had the disorder.
For social skills combined treatment was best.
Adhd is an educated guess,'' McCormick said.
The guidelines are for children 6 through 12.
The academy, the nation's largest group of pediatricians, said it is unclear whether the disorder is being overdiagnosed, because doctors' definitions and treatment of it varies widely.
Guidelines for treating Adhd are still being developed.
Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the most common treatment for Adhd, which affects up to 2.5 million school-age children in the United States.
Adhd is a neurological and genetic disorder that, Barkley said, is the most widely inherited trait of any psychiatric disorder.
Estimates are that 2 million to 5 million adults have Adhd.
The treatment is controversial, since methylphenidate shares many of the pharmacological effects of cocaine and is addictive to test animals.
The availability of an easy-to-use pill is sure to fuel the debate about whether Adhd is overdiagnosed _ and whether Ritalin or its generic alternatives are overprescribed.
Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving.
