Levitt, director of Political Analysis of this organization, said that Carter is worried by Peru's electoral process, which has been questioned by international observers.
``The purpose of our mission is to assess the state of the electoral process, and to demonstrate by our presence and activities the confidence of the international community in the Mexican people's commitment to free and fair elections.'' The mission observers belong to the Carter Center group.
The presence of Carter and his delegation to monitor the elections is also seen as part of efforts to enhance the credibility of the polls.
He and others from the Atlanta-based Carter Center observed what is supposed to the cleanest and most competitive presidential election ever in Mexico.
``If the voting process and the counting of the ballots and the reporting of the results are deemed to be transparent and without flaws of any significant degree,'' Carter said, ``they indeed will accept the results of the election _ even though they retain the right to criticize some previous activities during the campaign.'' The process, Carter warned, leaves the door open for efforts to buy assembly members' votes.
Founded in 1982 by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his wife, the Carter Center has been devoted to observing many countries in respect of democracy and development, human rights issues and public health.
In the statement the observation of the transit program was designed to support and call international attention to Nigeria's courageous steps to form a democratic society.
