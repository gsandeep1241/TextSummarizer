LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash.
_ For roughly half of the millions of salmon born on the Snake River that set out each spring for the Pacific Ocean, the journey past four federal dams is an arduous and often lethal one.
They can be whacked to death by giant blades of the dam turbines, knocked out from collisions with concrete spillways, or succumb to a fatal condition not unlike the bends.
The other half of the salmon have a much simpler trip: They get to take the boat.
But this annual free ride, by which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers loads the young fish on barges and totes them around the dams, is coming under scrutiny like never before.
And for scientists, lawmakers, farmers, fishermen, American Indians, barge shippers, environmentalists and a breathtaking array of other interested parties, the assessment is most likely the key to a momentous decision that will ultimately fall to Congress: whether to take down the Snake River dams altogether.
The job of protecting the baby salmon, so they can mature and breed, is a remarkable feat of engineering and an expensive _ critics say outlandish _ accommodation to man's demands for electricity.
Thousands of fish a day are diverted to a channel leading to a pipe that runs into a trailer downstream of this dam, the first of the four, which is near the Idaho border.
