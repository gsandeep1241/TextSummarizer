Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection identified a `West Nile-like` virus in the victim on Friday and were continuing to determine the specific strain, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said.
Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying now under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus.
Centers for Disease Control officials left New Jersey on Wednesday to await the results of tests on mosquitoes and sparrows in four northern counties that could show how far west the West Nile virus has spread.
Environmental officials announced plans Monday to spray insecticide in a two-mile radius where researchers found a dead crow with West Nile virus, the first time the virus was detected in Rhode Island.
Late Friday, the agency changed its diagnosis to West Nile-like virus.
The agency, which regularly passes federal disease-fighting money along to the states, said last month that it would distribute up to $2.5 million to states for fighting West Nile.
