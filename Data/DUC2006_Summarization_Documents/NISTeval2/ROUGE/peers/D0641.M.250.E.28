Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study suggests.
The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in temperatures but by favoring certain established weather patterns.
While the study does not prove that human induced global warming is what caused the change in frequency of circulation patterns, he said, the change is consistent with it.
The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6 to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming the tropics but cooling the polar regions.
The data suggest that global warming has caused a slowdown of the Earth at a rate of 0.56 milliseconds a century.
This warming would touch off widespread disruptions in climate and weather and cause the global sea level to rise and flood many places.
In Beijing, chinese scientists believe that global warming, particularly higher winter temperatures, will continue to the first half of the 21 st century.
In San Antonio, while the Global Climate Coalition questions whether global warming is happening, it advocates that companies voluntarily explore and employ new technology to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming.
In Washington, greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as as the, a new scientific study predicted recently.
