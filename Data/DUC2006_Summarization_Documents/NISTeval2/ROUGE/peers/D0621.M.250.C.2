As a reputed local crime boss fights his death sentence in China, reports Thursday said Hong Kong officials had previously asked mainland counterparts to consider sparing the lives of territory residents convicted of capital offenses in China.
Zhang Fusen, head of the Chinese delegation, told the fifth session of the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) that China will participate in United Nations activities in crime prevention and criminal justice.
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times.
China has revised the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law, promulgated and enforced new laws such as the Lawyers' Law and the Law on Administrative Punishment to strengthen the judicial guarantee for human rights during that period of time, the paper says.
Following the promulgation and enforcement of the Administrative Procedure Law and the Law on State Compensation, in March of 1996, China promulgated the Law on Administrative Punishment, thus standardizing in terms of system the act of administrative punishment by the governments, the white paper says.
Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs which entered China from overseas.
Zhang said that China amended its Criminal Law recently to enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering, terrorist crime, trafficking of illegal immigrants and environment-related crimes.
