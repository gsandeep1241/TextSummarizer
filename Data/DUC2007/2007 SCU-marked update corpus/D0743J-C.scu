said Roger Sullivan, sent as part of Washington's assistance program to Turkey after the earthquake.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="39"/></line><line>&quot;From an engineering standpoint it's easier to knock down a building and start again than try and reinforce, but it's tough to tell people that you're going to wipe out their structure where all their savings went,&quot; he said.</line><line>But some groups are not waiting for help from the government, which was accused by many of being slow to react after the earthquake.</line><line>Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up their own tent camps.</line><line>This makes sense for businesses eager to get back to work and worried that their workers will go elsewhere in the search for temporary shelter, but it also reflects the way in which nongovernmental groups have jumped in to help survivors while governmental efforts are still somewhat disorganized.</line><line>At the Pakmaya yeast factory in Izmit, a private company that exports to 100 countries, officials said they were preparing to break ground to build 80 housing units for workers who lost their homes.</line><line>&quot;The employees contributed to our earnings over the years, and now it's our turn to share these gains with our workers,&quot;
