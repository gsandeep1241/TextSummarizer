he said.</line><line>&quot;In a lot of ways, this is exactly what the evidence showed.&quot;</line><line>Pronouncing himself &quot;enormously pleased&quot; with the decision, Klein said it showed that &quot;in America, no person and no company is above the law.&quot;</line><line>Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft, asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had portrayed &quot;a predator that has misused its monopolistic power.&quot;</line><line>Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly determined to remain a monopoly.</line><line>Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications.</line><line>&quot;Today, we have established a solid beachhead,&quot; he said.</line><line>Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry.</line><line>But Klein deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the nationwide telephone system.</line><line>Blumenthal of Connecticut called antitrust law &quot;the Magna Carta of consumer protection.&quot;</line><line>&quot;I would wager that these findings of fact will be used in law school classes around the country to demonstrate what happens when the antitrust laws are flagrantly violated,&quot;

should apply to the case.</line><line>The intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.</line><line>The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government, Microsoft and antitrust experts.</line><line>Unlike other filings, it is not an advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.</line><line>Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief.</line><line>Instead, he stated that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.</line><line>But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply - and he raises doubts that it does - Microsoft might well have violated the law.</line><line>A company is guilty of illegal tying if it makes consumers accept a second product as a condition of buying a market-leading product.</line><line>The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system.<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="51"/></line><line>Microsoft asserts that the browser is not a separate product but an &quot;integrated feature&quot; of Windows.</line><line>In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a &quot;plausible claim&quot; that bundling had some benefit to consumers.</line><line>But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a &quot;consent decree,&quot; essentially a contractual agreement between the federal prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was &quot;no reason to read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the contours of antitrust law.&quot;</line><line>At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software was &quot;unsettled&quot; and added that the 1998 ruling was &quot;just one, if prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty.&quot;<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="50"/></line><line>Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal with physical products like cars and tires.</line><line>If given a chance at a software tying case, Lessig added, &quot;it is my view that there is a significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current doctrine.&quot;</line><line>&quot;Both sides&quot; in the Microsoft case, he wrote, &quot;are too quick, however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly applies to software products.&quot;</line><line>Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software - that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a dominant company engages in what he calls &quot;strategic bundling.&quot;<annotation scu-count="0" sum-count="1" sums="47"/></line><line>&quot;The aim of any antitrust inquiry,&quot;
