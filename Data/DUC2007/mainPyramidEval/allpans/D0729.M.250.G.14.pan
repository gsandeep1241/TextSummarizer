  <line>Eric Robert Rudolph was charged with bombing an abortion clinic in Birmingham, AL on Jan. 29, 1998 and three earlier bombings in Atlanta, GA 1996-97.</line>
  <line>The Birmingham bombing killed one person and injured another.</line>
  <line>The Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta killed one and injured 111 while bombings at an Atlanta abortion clinic and a gay bar injured nine.</line>
  <line>Pursuit of Rudolph began within hours of the Birmingham bombing.</line>
  <line>The operation involved the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local legal authorities.</line>
  <line>The search scoured the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina where Rudolph lived as a boy.</line>
  <line>The area is heavily forested mountainous terrain with peaks reaching to 5000 feet, heavy hardwood forests and thickets of virtually impenetrable rhododendron.</line>
  <line>Hundreds of mines and caves dot the area.</line>
  <line>It was thought that Rudolph, an accomplished sportsman and survivalist, was able to hide in inaccessible mines or caves while stealing food for sustenance.</line>
  <line>The search for Rudolph involved as many as 200 armed officers and employed bloodhounds and helicopters with infrared viewing capability.</line>
  <line>The FBI placed Rudolph on its ten most wanted list and offered a reward of $1 million for information leading to his apprehension.</line>
  <line>After a year without success the search was scaled back and in March 2002 it was announced that the task force would dismantle its command post in June.</line>
  <line>In August it was reported that the 31-month unsuccessful pursuit of Rudolph had cost $24.6 million.</line>

  <line>Eric Robert Rudolph, a 31-year old carpenter with ties to extremist religious groups is one of the FBI's ten most wanted.</line>
  <line>He is charged with the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta that killed one person and injured 111.</line>
  <line>He is also believed responsible for two other Atlanta area bombings: an abortion clinic that injured five, and one at a gay nightclub.</line>
  <line>Rudolph is charged with the bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama, abortion clinic that killed an off-duty policeman and injured a nurse.</line>
  <line>Rudolph has eluded capture despite a manhunt effort that at times numbered over 200 federal and local law enforcement officials.</line>
  <line>The officers have used bloodhounds, experienced trackers and a helicopter with infrared viewing equipment in the hunt for Rudolph.</line>
  <line>A reward of $1M has been offered.</line>
  <line>Bo Gritz, former Green Beret colonel, hoped to muster 100 men to find Rudolph and persuade him to surrender, but he and 40 volunteers were unsuccessful.</line>
  <line>Rudolph is believed to be hiding in the 530,000-acre Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area in western North Carolina, which is near Rudolph's home.</line>
  <line>He is an outdoorsman, a survivalist and is familiar with the area.</line>
  <line>He is believed to have altered his appearance by growing a beard and ponytail.</line>
  <line>At one point, he obtained a six-months supply of food and stole a pick-up truck to transport it to a campground near the forest.</line>

  <line>Eric Rudolph, a 31-year old carpenter is wanted for bombing an Alabama abortion clinic on 29 January 1998 and three bombings in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997.</line>
  <line>An explosion July 27, 1996 at Centennial Olympic Park killed one woman and injured 111 people.</line>
  <line>In a pair of explosions January 27, 1997, seven people were injured outside an Atlanta abortion clinic.</line>
  <line>A bombing at a gay nightclub in Atlanta February 21, 1997 injured five people.</line>
  <line>Rudolph became a suspect when witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the January 1998 bombing.</line>
  <line>A North Carolina license plate on the man's truck was traced to him.</line>
  <line>Six months later, Rudolph was identified by a food store owner near Nantahale Lake in Western North Carolina not far from where he first lived.</line>
  <line>He stole the man's truck and took about a six-month supply of food.</line>
  <line>About 200 FBI, state, and local officials began searching the remote densely forested area employing helicopters, dogs, and survival-training volunteers.</line>
  <line>Evidence from the abandoned truck, buried trash, and boot prints proved he was in the area.</line>
  <line>A one-million dollar reward for information, distribution of photos, and prime-time TV exposure were employed to no avail.</line>
  <line>Rudolph has eluded police for three years.</line>
  <line>He is an experienced survivalist, knows the area well, has altered his identity by growing a beard and long hair, and is probably hiding in one of the area's hundreds of caves or mines.</line>
  <line>The search effort has been reduced to relying on volunteer information.</line>

  <line>Eric Rudolph was charged in several bombings, including three in Atlanta, Georgia (Centennial Olympic Park, an abortion clinic in Atlanta, and a gay nightclub), and one at a Birmingham, Alabama, abortion clinic.</line>
  <line>Rudolph was connected to the Alabama bombing but escaped a police dragnet and, loaded up with food and supplies, hid for five and a half months in the woods of western North Carolina.</line>
  <line>He emerged only once to obtain a six-month supply of food and steal a pick-up - then disappeared into the woods again.</line>
  <line>He was known to be an outdoorsman and survivalist and was hiding in familiar woods near his childhood home.</line>
  <line>The man from whom Rudolph had obtained the food and truck had waited at least two days to report the stolen pickup, but was not suspected of aiding Rudolph.</line>
  <line>He provided an updated description of him, thinner with beard and ponytail.</line>
  <line>In searching for Rudolph the government conducted one of the most extensive manhunts in recent history.</line>
  <line>The FBI put him on the 10-Most-Wanted list and offered a million dollar reward for information leading to his arrest.</line>
  <line>As many as 200 agents at a time were searching the woods for him.</line>
  <line>Investigators used trackers, helicopters, dogs, and sophisticated surveillance equipment.</line>
  <line>In March 2000, the task force was to dismantle the command post because the trail had grown cold.</line>
  <line>The publicly acknowledged cost of the 31-month search was 24.6 million dollars.</line>
  <line>As of 18 August 2000 Rudolph had not been found.</line>

  <line>However, since the FBI began paying the fees months ago, the scouts haven't been any more successful in finding Rudolph than anything else the agents have tried.</line>
  <line>Federal agents searching for Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph have found what they believe was an observation point where the fugitive watched the Nantahala residence of a man whose help he tried to enlist for food and other provisions.</line>
  <line>A nurse who was seriously injured in the 1998 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic is suing fugitive suspect Eric Robert Rudolph, partly in an effort to block any profits he might receive from a book or movie, her attorney said.</line>
  <line>The 31-month search for Atlanta Olympic bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has cost the FBI an estimated $11.2 million, bringing the publicly acknowledged cost of the search to $24.6 million.</line>
  <line>Federal officials said on Monday that there was no evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.</line>
  <line>The task force that has hunted serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph for two years will dismantle its command post in the rugged Southern Appalachians by the end of June.</line>
  <line>A $1 million dollar reward on his head has made information leading to Rudolph's arrest a hot commodity for bounty hunters.</line>
  <line>Meanwhile, mechanics in Atlanta were examining a 1977 Nissan pickup truck, trying to determine how far Rudolph may have driven it.</line>
